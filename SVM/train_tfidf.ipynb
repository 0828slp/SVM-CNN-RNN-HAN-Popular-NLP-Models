       "['Switzerland’s Holbe is planning to sell its Latvian woodworking plant and is looking for bids of at least EUR 25.00 million, according to Dienas Bizness.  Latvian News Agency picked up the report, which claimed production has been halted at the Riga-based veneer producer Rigas Finieru Rupnica.  Holbe has received local and foreign interest in the unit but so far would-be buyers have not offered enough money, Latvian News Agency said.  The Swiss holding company stressed that the divestment is not a fire sale and it will not exit Finieru Rupnica for less than the stated price.  The 17-year-old woodworking plant, which generates almost all of its revenue from exports, shut down last year due to plummeting foreign demand and began selling the stock standing idle in its warehouse.  It produces peeled and sliced veneer from more than 30 different species, including walnut, oak and pine, principally for the EU market.   The wood is used anywhere from car interiors to furniture and doors, and Finieru Rupnica specialises in processing birch from northern and eastern Europe.  Its capacity stretches to 20 million square metres of veneer per year and the buyer will get access to all its machinery and land – the main reason Holbe will not reduce its asking price.  Citing experts it did not name, Latvian News Agency said demand for plywood is set to gradually increase.   Holbe, the investment company owned by the family of the woodworking entrepreneur Hans-Jörg Danzer, took over Riga Plywood from the German veneer producer Furnierwerk Winsen, which bought in almost four years ago.  Finieru Rupnica is the sister plant of the Winsen company, which counts itself as the largest of its kind in the European market.  Danzer Group, co-founded by Danzer in the 1970s, is now one of the world’s leading manufacturers of hardwood veneers and lumber.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'French telecommunications player Numericable has agreed to purchase the entirety of Virgin Mobile France, which is currently operated as a joint venture between UK giants Carphone Warehouse and Virgin Group.  Under the terms of the deal, the Puteaux-headquartered firm will pay EUR 325.00 million for the business.  Virgin Mobile France, which operates through its holding company Omea Telecom, was founded as a joint venture between Virgin and the Carphone Warehouse in 2004.  At present, the latter holds a 46.0 per cent share of the business, while the former has an identical stake and the balance is owned by the target’s management team.  Completion of the deal is dependent on approval from the French Competition Authority.  In addition to France, where it has 2,500 retail locations, Virgin Mobile is present in Australia, the US, Canada, the UK and South Africa, among others, with more than 18.00 million customers worldwide.  According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, there have been 27 deals targeting French wireless telecoms firms this year, the most notable of which was Altice’s planned EUR 14.25 billion acquisition of Société Française de Radiotéléphone, which was announced in mid-June.  For its part, Numericable’s most recent purchase was in October 2013 when it announced plans to pick up Audincourt-headquartered cable television channel and network operator Valvision for an undisclosed sum.  The Euronext-listed buyer, which is based in Champs-sur-Marne, claims to be the leader in its field, with a 65.0 per cent share of the French market.  Its offering includes television, broadband internet and phone packages and revenue for the first quarter of 2014 stood at EUR 328.00 million, up from EUR 325.00 million in the opening three months of 2013.  Numericable’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation for the period totalled EUR 154.00 million, compared to EUR 151.00 million over the corresponding period last year.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " \"The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is lopping off parts of its retail and commercial banking business in eight markets due to capital constraints.  Last month, RBS posted the biggest loss in British corporate history – a staggering GBP 24.05 billion.  Its Asian retail and commercial banking unit is present in markets such as India, Pakistan, China and Singapore.   The division provides financial services across four segments: affluent banking, cards and consumer finance, business banking and international wealth management, which offers private banking and investment services to clients in selected markets through the RBS Coutts brand.  Like moths to a flame, HSBC, Standard Chartered and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group are all believed to be considering making bids for these Asian assets.  RBS chairman Philip Hampton is reported as saying that the Edinburgh-based institution has decided to sell its retail and commercial banking activities in Singapore but will retain its investment banking and wholesale operations.  Cited by the Business Times, he added that private bank RBS Coutts will also be kept under the wing of the British financial institution.  Besides Singapore, other divisions belonging to RBS’s Asian unit to be put on the block are in Malaysia, India, China and Hong Kong, among others.  “It's early days yet, we expect a significant level of interest from serious banks,” Mr Hampton told the Business Times when asked how the sale is going.  French banking giant BNP Paribas is in talks with the Edinburgh-based institution with regards to the latter’s Indian operations, the Financial Chronicle’s news website mydigitalfc.com reported yesterday.  It quoted a banker close to the French group as saying: “The global management team of BNP Paribas is keen on taking over RBS’s assets in India.”  When contracted by mydigitalfc.com, V Vasantha Kumar, a RBS spokesperson in India, said: “The RBS group is considering a potential sale of its retail and commercial business in Asia.   “As with all transactions, we will not be commenting on any specific detail until such times as we have an announcement to make to the market.”  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Grupo Leche Pascual, the Spanish dairy products company, could be about to sell a significant minority stake to private equity investors, according to a trade publication.  Quoting a Madrid-based executive familiar with the process, Just-Food claimed Britain’s 3i and Ibersuizas of Spain are among the bidders looking for a Leche Pascual shareholding.  The group, which counts the number one domestic milk brand among its portfolio, needs cash to meet short-term credit obligations, the source said.  According to Just-Food, it has EUR 400.00 million in debt.  The source suggested the Burgos-based firm would consider divesting a stake of up to 30.0 per cent.   Earlier this year the Spanish press claimed Pedro Astals, director of Leche Pascual’s rival Central Lechera Asturiana (Clas), is seeking a merger.  Reports in May said Astals would like to tie Clas with Leche Pascual and Granada-based Puleva to create a dairy heavyweight capable of competing with the major European players.  Leche Pascual is also present in the fruit juice, cereals, mineral water and animal feed segments.  It generated EUR 960.13 million in revenue in 2006 after an annual increase of 2.2 per cent (FY 2005: EUR 939.23 million; FY 2004: EUR 884.87 million).  Despite a long history of consistent sales growth, Leche Pascual posted a net loss of EUR 11.57 million in 2006. It failed to return to profit after a EUR 14.87 million loss in 2005 (FY 2004: EUR 6.65 million net profit).   Buyout group 3i is already a shareholder in Spain’s top coffee shop chain Café y Té. Its other investments include the French dairy dessert manufacturer Senoble and Dutch fruit juice supplier Refresco.  Ibersuizas is a food industry backer, but is yet to invest in the dairy segment.   Neither firm would comment on the report.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Nielsen, which provides television viewing ratings, among other things, is buying US media and marketing research firm Arbitron for USD 1.26 billion in cash, in a deal that will bring together TV and radio audience measurement under one umbrella.  The Dutch group is offering USD 48.00 per share to stockholders of the Maryland-based company, representing a 26.2 per cent premium to Monday’s close of USD 38.04.  Following the announcement, Nielsen stock ended the day up 4.4 per cent at USD 30.92, while Arbitron finished 23.6 per cent higher at USD 47.03.  According to a statement, the two companies generated total revenues of USD 6.00 billion and combined pro forma adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of USD 1.70 billion based on the 12 months to 30th September 2012.  William Kerr, president and chief executive of Arbitron, observed: “Radio reaches more than 92.0 per cent of all American teens and adults because they love to listen to music, talk, news and information while at home, at work and in their cars.  “By combining Nielsen’s global capabilities and scale with Arbitron’s unique radio measurement and listening information, advertisers and media clients will have better insights into consumer behaviour and the return on marketing investments.”  The boards of both companies have approved the deal, but it still requires the nod from regulators, and Reuters cited an analyst as saying there is a chance the transaction will not receive the green light.  In addition to radio, Arbitron also serves the television, cable and out-of-home, mobile and advertising industries, providing audience measurement and analytics in the US, Europe, Asia and Australia.  With the assets acquired in the takeover, Nielsen intends to further expand its Watch metric, spanning screens and forms of listening.  Earlier this week, the New York-listed group joined forces with social media site Twitter to create a new audience measurement tool based on tweets about TV shows.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The Telegraph picked up on comments made to analysts by Steve Hare, when he said the firm could opt to exit the payments segment entirely.  Sage is already considering jettisoning its North American payments unit, having put the business on the block in December.  According to the Telegraph, the UK, Ireland and South Africa payments businesses have combined annual revenues of about GBP 40.00 million.  Hare said that following a review of its activities Sage plans to look into how best to participate in the payments field and has floated the idea of potentially partnering with other providers, rather than carrying out the service via an owned subsidiary.  However, he cautioned that there is no guarantee of a deal going ahead as the company may decide to retain the UK, Ireland and South Africa units if a sale of the North American business goes ahead.  Sage was founded in 1981 and now employs more than 13,000 people in 23 countries in Europe, North and South America, Africa, Asia and Oceania.  The company has been publicly-traded since 1981.  Sage posted revenue of GBP 1.57 billion in 2016, up on the GBP 1.44 billion generated over the preceding 12 months.

According to the Telegraph, Bhs’ logistics, marketing and finance functions are to be merged with those of Arcadia. Reuters said property operations could also be combined.   There are plans to turn Bhs outlets into brand houses that would sell various Arcadia names such as Wallis, Evans and Topshop.  At present, the Bhs department store business is run as a separate entity, but after the combination it would operate as an Arcadia brand.  Sales at Bhs dipped 1.6 per cent year-on-year to GBP 850.24 million in the 12 months to 31st March 2008 (FY 2007: GBP 864.45 million; FY 2006: GBP 851.86 million; FY 2005: GBP 880.90 million; FY 2004: GBP 881.46 million).

       " 'A consortium of two US-based private equity firms and a German trade buyer have reached the second round of bidding for GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK’s) non-core over the counter (OTC) drugs, according to press speculation.  Bain Capital and Blackstone Group are the buyout firms and Boehringer Ingelheim is the strategic bidder, sources with knowledge of the matter told the Financial Times (FT).  The newspaper suggested the sale could bring in GBP 1.50 billion and is being arranged by Goldman Sachs.  GSK is selling a long list of diverse drugs, the FT said, noting that this makes the disposal complicated.   Back in February the British pharmaceuticals maker said it would dispose of non-core European and US OTC products accounting for annual revenue of around GBP 500.00 million – equivalent to just under 10.0 per cent of the GBP 5.01 billion generated by GSK’s consumer health division in 2010.  During the 12 months to 31st December 2010, all of GSK’s OTC medicines brought in sales of GBP 2.46 billion.   The group’s focus will now be emerging markets and priority brands – which it did not name earlier this year when it announced the sale plan.   Last year GSK’s net earnings plunged by 70.5 per cent to GBP 1.63 billion from GBP 5.53 billion in 2009. This was the weakest bottom-line result in records dating back more than a decade.  Revenue was 1.2 per cent lower, at GBP 28.71 billion from GBP 29.06 billion in 2009.  Bain is likely to bid for all 19 of the non-core drugs on offer, according to the FT. These include the Alli weight management therapy, the Nytol sleep aid and pain relief medication Solpadine.  They could fetch three times sales – a GBP 1.50 billion price tag – if they are sold together, one of the sources said.    © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'The private equity arm of South Africa’s Investec Asset Management could buy up to a fifth of the supermarket chain OK Zimbabwe, according to Business Day.  William Alexander, the principal officer of 0ed investor Africa Frontier Private Equity Fund, told the South African finance daily that Africa Frontier would make a USD 5.00 million convertible loan available to OK Zimbabwe.  The fund will also underwrite a USD 15.00 million rights issue to allow existing owners to participate in the fundraiser, Alexander is quoted as saying.  Africa Frontier could secure between 10.0 per cent and 20.0 per cent of the supermarket chain – Zimbabwe’s second by number of stores – depending on the outcome of the rights offering, Business Day said.  Alexander told the paper OK Zimbabwe has an “excellent franchise” in its domestic market.  His fund would be betting on recovery over the coming years and this would be its first investment in the politically troubled region.  Local news reports suggest the supermarket operator, and its rivals TM Supermarkets and Spar, are still increasing prices.   They have been closing down stores for years, unable to operate in an environment of hyperinflation and government-imposed price controls.  Back in 2008, Zim Daily claimed OK Zimbabwe might completely withdraw from the country.  The chain sources most of its imported goods from South Africa via high-cost third-party suppliers, Business Day observed. It said TM Supermarkets relies on its Johannesburg shareholder Pick n Pay for stock.  There has been talk of South Africa’s Shoprite Holdings seeking a controlling share of OK Zimbabwe and reports last week suggested Africa Frontier might be buying into the business on behalf of Shoprite.  Alexander told Business Day this is “totally incorrect”.  Last autumn Shoprite said it will not seek investment opportunities in neighbouring Zimbabwe in the short-term because of the political and economic turmoil in the country.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

A further USD 125.00 million earn-out consideration will be payable upon the meeting of certain clinical and regulatory milestones.  The deal expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.  California-based Apama Medical is an early-stage atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter research and development company with 40 employees.   The firm’s Apama Radiofrequency (RF) Balloon Catheter System combines different medical approaches to the treatment of AF, a syndrome which causes an irregular heartbeat.  With CE mark approval expected in late 2018, Apama Medical is currently conducting clinical trials on the concept device in Europe.  President of rhythm management at Boston Scientific, Joe Fitzgerald said that the transaction “further advances our continued investment in the electrophysiology category, and, upon commercialisation, would broaden our portfolio of differentiated arrhythmia solutions.”  Listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Boston Scientific is headquartered in Marlborough, Massachusetts and has over 27,000 employees.  For H1 2017, the company posted net income of USD 436.00 million on a US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles basis, a significant improvement compared to a loss of USD 5.00 million for the same period last year.  Established in 1979, Boston Scientific is not expecting the transaction to make a notable difference to its adjusted earnings per share for both 2017 and 2018.

Following the transaction, 3M is expected to transfer a team of about 450 experts to Gemalto, allowing the buyer to in-source biometric technology to round out its government programmes offering and venture into commercial markets.   John Riccardi, vice president and general manager of the seller’s traffic safety and security division, said: “After completing a thorough strategic review, we believe that the identity management business will be better positioned with a company that is primarily focused on security solutions.”  Earlier this week, 3M announced the sale of its prescription eyewear unit to Hoya Vision Care for an undisclosed sum to focus on its core personal safety segment.

       " 'US beer maker Lagunitas Brewing is working with Wells Fargo to look at strategic options, one of which may be the sale of an equity interest that could value the business at about USD 450.00 million, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.   The Californian firm is one of a growing number of the country’s craft brewers, which are independent of the multinationals and use this individuality as a selling point in attracting new customers.   Lagunitas has been exploring strategic alternatives for several months, as chief executive Tony Magee, a former musician and print salesman, plans to expand the business he founded over 20 years ago, the people said.  A joint venture is another option under consideration, some of the sources told Reuters.  There is no certainty that any deal will go ahead, the people added.  None of the sources wished to be identified because the process is confidential. The company and Wells Fargo declined to comment.  Lagunitas produces a wide range of beers, among them CitruSinensis, which is made with blood orange flavours, and High Westified Coffee stout, brewed with coffee then aged in rye barrels.  Its flagship label is India Pale Ale, a fashionable bitter beer, and it also produces a smoother pale wheat ale called Lil Sumpin’ Sumpin’.  Headquartered in Petaluma, Lagunitas has additional breweries around California and Chicago, with one planned for Los Angeles.  Craft brewers are gaining in popularity in the US, as consumers seek alternatives to mainstream brands like Coors and Budweiser.   The fact that businesses are small, independent and focus entirely on the ingredients they use in their beers is what attracts people, as well as the array of new and innovative flavours available.  A craft brewer is defined as one where annual production is 6.00 million barrels per year or under and 25.0 per cent or less is owned or controlled by a beverage alcohol industry member that is not itself a craft brewer.  Last month Reuters reported that Atlanta-based SweetWater Brewing, known for its 420 Extra Pale Ale and Hop Hash beers, is planning to go for an initial public offering that could take place later this year and value the business in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Tencent wants to take full control of Chinese travel firm eLong for USD 622.00 million as it seeks to tap into a boom in the country’s tourism market.  Under terms of the non-binding proposal announced yesterday, the Internet giant is offering USD 18.00 per American depository share in the Nasdaq-traded company.  That represents a 24.1 per cent premium to eLong’s close of USD 14.50 on 31st July and values the business at around USD 689.00 million.  Tencent already indirectly holds about a 15.0 per cent stake and by taking full control of the company the conglomerate hopes to gain a bigger slice of China’s burgeoning travel industry.  It will also have the opportunity to beef up its online-to-offline offerings, a key growth area according to technology blog TechCrunch.  eLong provides mobile and online accommodation reservation services in the People’s Republic, enabling users to book hotels, as well as air and train tickets.  Major shareholders include rival player Ctrip, which is currently ranked as China’s top online travel agency with a 23.0 per cent market share, according to data from China Internet Watch.  In May US giant Expedia, formerly eLong’s biggest stockholder, sold its 62.4 per cent interest to Ctrip, Keystone Lodging Holdings, Plateno Group and Luxuriant Holdings for USD 671.00 million.  Tencent has been aggressively acquiring businesses to expand its offering and compete with rivals Alibaba and Baidu for a bigger slice of the Chinese online market, particularly the growing number of people using mobile services.  It is already known for local messaging services WeChat and QQ and holds stakes in US-based Glu Mobile and Internet classifieds service 58.com, among others.  Tencent’s other travel-related investments include group discounts site 17u.cn and Woqu.com, which allows users to tailor their itineraries for trips to the US.

       " 'Vietnam is getting ready to combine its two stock exchanges, located in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, one of the key decision makers told the Financial Times (FT).  Tran Duc Sinh, chief executive of Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE), said the Vietnamese finance ministry is “preparing a plan” to combine his business with its smaller rival in the communist party stronghold.  “Our market is on a small scale, we need to enhance our competitiveness and our Asean [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] neighbours have one exchange, so we should have the same,” he told the FT.  HOSE was established in 2000 and is an administrative agency of the state securities commission. It began as Ho Chi Minh City Securities Trading Center and was later upgraded and renamed.  The group started with two listings – Refrigeration Electrical Engineering and Saigon Cable and Telecommunication – but now hosts over 300 companies as well as trading government bonds.  Hanoi Securities Trading Centre was launched in the spring of 2005. It became Hanoi Stock Exchange (HSE) four years later.   HSE had hoped to carry out an initial public offering after being upgraded to a state-owned limited liability company, though nothing came of the plan.   The two markets compete with China and Hong Kong’s fast-growing exchanges, and Vietnam appears to have taken the political decision to establish one national flagship exchange.  Japan has already recognised the need to merge its two largest bourses – the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Securities Exchange – and talks to combine the two are ongoing.  This follows significant global consolidation in the industry, creating heavyweights such as NYSE Euronext, which is itself trying to tie up with Deutsche Börse.    © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The deal marks its entry into Peru, where press reports have said the company may become the principal player in the bulk-buy segment.    Alvi operates 11 stores in the country under the Mayorsa brand.   SMU said of the deal: “This operation implies not only the strengthening of our group in the bulk-buy sector, but also our arrival in Peru, a market that offers great development opportunities.”  Last year the Santiago-based holding company agreed to acquire the Telemercados Europa supermarket chain.

The firm is looking for fresh capital for the next phase of its international expansion, the newspaper suggested. It has been moving deeper into Asia and the Middle East in recent years.  Two people with knowledge of the matter told the FT that Phoenix has appointed Lexicon Partners to assess the possibility of finding a buyer for all or part of the company.   Citing industry observers, the paper put a price tag of GBP 300.00 million on Asco, though the report said a potential investor might buy a stake alongside Phoenix.  Phoenix’s strategy for the business was to broaden its service offering in existing markets and develop its international activities.

Details of a deal are still being discussed by both parties though it is hoped a definitive agreement may be signed by the end of February.  SMB has five breweries located across the Philippines and counts among its brands names such as San Miguel Pale Pilsen, Red Horse, San Mig Light and Gold Eagle.

Net income for the period rose 22.8 per cent year-on-year to PHP 7.01 billion from PHP 5.71 billion.  San Miguel, which is 19.9 per cent owned by Kirin, generated net revenue of PHP 122.20 billion, 15.6 per cent higher than the comparable period in 2007 (PHP 105.80 billion).

The USD 12.00 million purchase of Equatorial Biofuels Guernsey (EBF) will provide an exit for Equatorial Palm Oil (EPO), a secretive Liberia-focused business that does not have a functioning website.  EPO had planned to list on London’s Alternative Investment Market, but presumably the economic turmoil has put paid to such ideas.   Agriterra, formerly the oil company White Nile, has signed a memorandum of understanding to buy the business and will proceed subject to due diligence.  It will purchase Liberia-focused EBF with a cash payment of USD 2.50 million and the allotment of 110.00 million of its own ordinary shares – which based on yesterday’s close of 5.25 pence (USD 0.09) can be valued at GBP 5.78 million.  Only recently out of a ruinous civil war which has left the economy in tatters, Liberia is rife with corruption, unemployment and illiteracy.   It is heavily reliant on agriculture – and the sparsely-populated forestland in from the coast lends itself to palm oil plantations.  Agriterra is focused on acquiring or investing in businesses in the farming and related civil engineering industries in Africa, with assets including a number of trading and processing companies in Mozambique.  The acquisition of EBF will bring strong relationships with local and regional government in Liberia, as the target company has a ratified 50-year investment agreement.   According to Agriterra, the business it is about to purchase has “limited impact” on virgin forests as it will specialise in reactivating and developing existing plantations and agricultural land bank.  Shares in Agriterra were 4.6 per cent higher at 11:14 am BST today on news of the investment, giving a market cap of GBP 26.06 million.  “The potential acquisition of EBF is in line with Agriterra's strategy to acquire or invest in businesses operating in the agricultural sector in Africa, and will complement its existing activities of grain processing and cattle ranching in Mozambique,” the group said.  It expects early cash flow from the deal – specifically from the reactivation of up to 10,000 hectares of existing plantations.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

The company has already 1 one acquisition this this year; in February it purchased an unknown minority interest in Pronutria Biosciences, a US-based cellular homeostasis oral biologics products developer, for USD 42.50 million.   Manchester-headquartered Phagenesis is focused on the treatment of dysphagia, the medical term for difficulty in swallowing, using its leading product Phagenyx, which uses pharyngeal electrical stimulation that delivers an electrical signal to the back of the throat.  Dysphagia occurs in about 29.0 per cent to 55.0 per cent of stroke patients, with around 15.00 million people suffering a stroke globally every year.  Greg Behar, chief executive of Nestlé Health Science, said: “Dysphagia is a strategic focus for Nestlé Health Science. This innovation can bring a new dimension to swallowing rehabilitation that can be transformational from a patient and healthcare professional perspective.”  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Italian construction group Salini Impregilo is searching for overseas acquisitions, the Financial Times (FT) reported, citing chief executive Pietro Salini.  He told the paper that due to Italy’s recession the company is also considering relocating its headquarters.  Salini Impregilo is looking for opportunities to grow and will acquire firms from outside its home country to establish itself in new markets, Salini added.  The group operates in over 50 countries but hasn’t managed to get its foot in the doors of the Australian and US markets, according to the financial daily.  Salini said he is more optimistic with regard to the Italian market’s prospects than at the beginning of this year, partly due to the arrival of new prime minister Matteo Renzi.  However, a relocation of the group’s headquarters has not been ruled out, and the FT added that doing so would see the company follow in the footsteps of domestic peer Fiat, which moved its main office to London last month.  Renzi also told the paper that around EUR 30.00 billion will be released for infrastructure projects in the country upon the approval of the government’s planned “Unblock Italy” decree.  Salini Impregilo claims to be one of Italy’s largest international companies.  It specialises in major, complex and dynamic projects worldwide and almost 85.0 per cent of its turnover comes from outside its home country, according to the FT.  Salini Impregilo has ongoing developments in railways, motorways and airports, civil and industrial buildings, dams and hydroelectric plants.   The company posted revenues of EUR 2.11 billion in the six months ended 30th June 2014, a 37.0 per cent increase on EUR 1.33 billion in the first half of 2013.  Salini Impregilo generated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of EUR 192.79 million in H1 2014, an 83.6 per cent increase on EUR 105.00 million in H1 2013.  The group was founded in 1959 as Impregilo and has been active in its current form since the completion of a reverse takeover by Salini in 2012.  Salini claims the company is on track to increase its revenues to EUR 7.00 billion by 2017, a 75.0 per cent increase on EUR 4.00 billion last year.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Cryptocurrency miner APAC Mining is working on launching an initial public offering (IPO) in London within the next six to nine months to finance the expansion of its computer farm capacity globally.  The Singapore-headquartered startup was formed to operate, manage and lease low-cost energy, large-scale, cloud-based facilities in Asia to private and institutional investors.  Its computing centres calculate the complex mathematical answers needed to confirm and verify cryptographic digital token transactions on the blockchain network in order to earn a fee and in-built rewards.  With an initial focus on establishing hubs in Malaysia, APAC intends to establish a location in Québec in the near future, with plans to expand to Mongolia at a later stage, depending on whether China cracks down on the industry.  The new site in this Canadian province, which has one of the lowest energy rates in the world due to a strong supply of hydroelectric power, will have the capacity to power up to 700 cryptocurrency mining servers.   APAC, which currently mines Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dashcoin and Litecoin, expects the hub will be operational in three months.  The IPO hopeful raised USD 1.00 million of seed capital from Fatfish Internet at the beginning of 2018 to finance the purchase of its computer equipment and to set up its centres.  It is now in “advanced discussions with prospective investment banks, accountants and lawyers” in relation to appointing advisors for the proposed overseas flotation.  Fatfish, which owns 51.0 per cent of the cryptocurrency miner following the seed investment, said that by having publicly-traded shares, the market will be able to assign its own value or market capitalisation to the business.  The Melbourne-based company is in the process of changing its name to Fatfish Blockchain to reflect its long-term strategic focus on opportunities in the sector.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Momentin Group will retain the remaining 20.0 per cent in the target following the transaction, but the deal includes an option allowing the buyer to purchase this share within the next few years.  The tie up comprises Servaali’s Finnish and Swedish operations, which reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation of EUR 2.00 million on EUR 27.00 million turnover for the year ending 30th June 2017, but excludes its subsidiaries in the Baltic countries.  Completion is expected in the first half of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals from the relevant regulatory bodies.  No further details were disclosed.  On 1st January 2018, a new law that increases the limit on alcohol content in drinks sold in grocery stores from 4.7 per cent to 5.5 per cent took effect in Finland.  According to Olvi chief Lasse Aho, this has led to an “increasing demand for stronger speciality beers and international beer brands and long drinks”, as well as quality and sparkling wines, in the country, driving the company to expand its product offering.  The buyer has therefore targeted Servaali, as it represents international brands, including Asahi, ABInbev, San Miguel, Langguth and Felix Solis Avantis, which fit into this growth strategy.  Established in 1878, the Nasdaq-listed firm had a market capitalisation of EUR 495.47 million as of 31st January 2018.

FTI Consulting, Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada Europe have all been hired to advise on the deal.   Rick Howes, chief executive of the vendor, noted: \"The proceeds from the sale will serve to strengthen our balance sheet and reduce future capital requirements, which can be utilised to support the future growth of our business, and allows us to focus on our remaining core assets.”  Founded in 1998, Polymetal is listed on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol POLY and is billed as a leading gold and silver producer in Russia and Kazakhstan.  Its shares were trading at GBP 6.56 at 1:30 pm today, valuing the firm at around GBP 2.79 billion.

       " 'Private equity firm KKR & Co is in advanced discussions to offload Singaporean computing parts manufacturer MMI Holdings to a Chinese investor, people close to the matter told Bloomberg.   According to these sources, the deal could value the business at around USD 700.00 million, including around USD 400.00 million in debt.   KKR has held the stake for over a decade, acquiring MMI through Precision Capital in 2007 for SGD 1.01 billion (USD 763.50 million), despite buyout groups typically exiting investments after between three and five years.  The private equity owner is said to be in talks with a fund affiliated with Beijing HBH Innovation Industry and a deal could be reached as soon as next month, one of the sources stated.   MMI makes over 26.00 million high-precision parts for computer hard disk drives weekly, as well as supplying components to the oil and gas and machinery industries, and producing hydraulic parts for the aerospace sector.   The company manages design centres and manufacturing facilities in China, Thailand, the US and Singapore, among other locations.   This is not the first time KKR has explored a divestment of its asset; in 2015, people familiar with the matter told news providers the investor was considering relisting MMI on the Singapore stock exchange but it decided to postpone due to market volatility at the time.   Bloomberg cited sources as saying the potential target has been expanding in recent years, boosting profit through acquisitions, increasing its automation services and purchasing technology and patent rights.   Shortly following its privatisation in 2007, MMI acquired an unnamed Singapore-based private company in the precision machining of aerospace components for SGD 22.10 million.   In 2010, it picked up a stake in MetalForm Asia for an undisclosed amount.   Should KKR exit MMI, it would be the latest in a large number of private equity divestments in Asia over the last 12 months, Bloomberg reported.  According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, there have been almost 30,000 mergers and acquisitions targeting companies based the Far East and Central Asia since February last year.

Under the terms of the transaction, the deal will be funded through a combination of cash reserves and bank loans totalling CNY 679.00 billion (USD 9.89 billion).  The offer price of USD 49.00 per share represents a 16.4 per cent premium to Nasdaq-listed IDT’s closing price of USD 42.08 on 10th September 2018, the last trading day prior to the deal being announced.   Subject to approvals from the target’s shareholders and relevant regulatory authorities, the acquisition is expected to complete in the first half of 2019.   Both parties’ boards have already unanimously voted in favour of the combination.  As a result of the acquisition, Renesas will broaden its portfolio within the semiconductor industry and gain access to IDT’s analogue mixed-signal products, including memory interface, smart sensors and optical interconnect systems, among others.   Reuters notes that the buyer’s desire to begin developing autonomous driving and connected car technologies was a factor in the decision to carry out the deal.  Bunsei Kure, chief executive of the Renesas, said: “IDT’s products combined with our MCUs, SoCs and power management ICs will enable Renesas to widen its product offerings as well as to expand its reach into areas such as the growing data economy-related space.”  However, an analyst has told Reuters that a transaction could be difficult due to the target’s lack of clients in the car sector.  Akira Minamikawa of IHS Markit, said: “IDT doesn’t have many automotive clients. Bringing their chips up to the level needed for automotive standards will not be easy.”  Headquartered in Tokyo, Renesas specialises in the designing and manufacturing of semiconductor products and claims to be the global leader in microcontrollers, analogue and other integrated platforms.

The Southern Hemisphere outdoor advertising-to-newspaper publisher’s entitlement offer comprises accelerated institutional and retail components at AUD 0.36 apiece, or a 12.5 per cent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price of AUD 0.41 per stock.   It is already safe in the knowledge that key shareholders have decided to support the acquisition, though Independent News & Media, while committed to its stake, will not take part in the equity dilution.  However, Allan Gray Australia, the local arm of global fund manager Orbis Group, and Baycliffe are planning to subscribe for new stocks.  As such, the investment vehicle controlled by businessman billionaire Denis O’Brien will continue to have a relevant 30.8 per cent interest following the dilution.  APN is taking over Australian Radio Network and New Zealand’s the Radio Network for AUD 246.50 million, gaining full control of the largest broadcasting station set-up across the two countries.   The purchase cost represents a multiple of 6.9 times enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) in the financial year ended 31st December 2013.  APN intends to fund the acquisition mainly from its entitlement offer but also with proceeds of AUD 60.00 million from the sale of its outdoor unit to Quadrant Private Equity last month and AUD 61.00 million in debt funded from existing facilities.

He noted that with the acquisition the group is securing assets which will boost audience figures and cement its relationships with advertisers, publishers and content providers.  There are also plans to hire the existing Grab Media team, which Mukherjee describes as “a talented, multi-faceted group with extensive experience and relationships in online video content syndication and advertising”.

The process is expected to complete in September, 12 weeks ahead of schedule, and should receive a cabinet green light by the end of month, chairman and managing director Shakeel Ahmed told Bloomberg today in an interview.   The news provider added that Ahmed has decided to modify the value of the fundraising exercise following a significant change in Hindustan Copper’s stock price so far this year.  Shares in the company have rocketed 67.4 per cent from a close of INR 280.35 on 4th January to INR 469.35 on 17th May – giving a market capitalisation of INR 434.25 billion (4th January: INR 259.38 billion).   Its securities fell 0.6 per cent by 3.56 pm today to INR 466.50 against a 0.2 per cent improvement in the Sensex index (16,875.76 points).  Ahmed told Bloomberg that proceeds will help Hindustan Copper meet “immediate expansion needs, including an acquisition” if an “appropriate asset” could be identified, either at home or abroad.

The beleaguered Guildford-based firm, which provides software to bookmakers and the hospitality industry, last closed at 16 pence. Its stocks rocketed as much as 11.5 pence (71.9 per cent) to a high of 27.5 pence in the day\\'s trading.  By 2pm, Alphameric\\'s London-listed share price had shrunk slightly to 25.75 pence, giving it a market value of GBP 34.144 million.  The group, which operates under its two Alphameric Leisure and Alphameric Hospitality subsidiaries, provides bespoke software applications and data broadcast systems.  In addition, its offering includes electronic point of sale systems and electronic keyboards, with the firm serving leading UK organisations such as Ladbrokes and Totesport in the gaming sector, and Costa Coffee and Prêt a Manger in the hospitality industry.  Alphameric\\'s equity value has diminished drastically over the last seven years. Its stocks traded as high as 680,900 pence at the start of the decade, and the group\\'s equity was worth GBP 211.028 million at the end the end of FY 2000.  Over the last 12 months, its stocks have lost 64.2 per cent of their value (25.03 pence), even taking account of Wednesday\\'s gains.  On releasing reports for fiscal 2006, Alphameric spoke of \"financial underperformance\"; net incomes were down 75.3 per cent over the year to GBP 1.623 million from GBP 6.576 million and by September this year a loss warning had been issued for FY 2007.  The group has traditionally had a poor history of maintaining net earnings, spending 2003 and 2004 in the red, with GBP 3.819 million and GBP 59.487 million losses respectively, before a brief return to a GBP 7 million profit in 2002 and further losses in 2001.  Losses associated with Amalgamated Racing, the group\\'s betting and data broadcasting joint venture with Racecourse Media Services, are set to bring about a \"significant\" financial loss for this year, Alphameric has warned.  It is currently embroiled in a legal battle with the UK\\'s big three bookmakers William Hill, Ladbrokes and Coral, which have refused to take on the service since it competes with their own initiative to cover races.  Given the problems faced, and the group\\'s slumping share prices, an offer at a substantial premium must be a welcome relief to shareholders.  However, the software specialist has a strong cashflow position and a history of weathering hits to its bottom line; it will be unlikely to accept an offer unless it places considerable value on its operations.  Alphameric has maintained a cash positive position since 2000 and though this was diminished last year (GBP 111,000 compared to GBP 5.555 million in 2005), it can afford to massively increase its 10.31 per cent gearing to withstand current pressures.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Its total harvest volume for in 2015 was 4,415 tonnes and the acquisition indirectly corresponds to 1.67 farming permits, including biomass and fixed assets, which yields an enterprise value per licence of NOK 51.00 million.  NRS is organised into two business areas, namely sales and farming, which in turn is divided into two geographical segments.  The company owns 35 licences for the production of farmed salmon divided between 29 contracts to the north located in Senja and western Finnmark and six permits in the south around Haugesund.  NSL’s activities lie within NRS’ northern sphere of activities, which comprises 19 contracts in Finnmark and 10 within the Troms cluster, held through an 82.5 per cent stake in Nor Seafood, 66.7 per cent interest in NSL and 100.0 per cent of NRS Feøy.  NRS’ acquisition would fortify its position in Troms, billed as an important future growth area for the fish farming industry.  The company’s northern division generated operating earnings before interest and tax on of NOK 98.95 million on revenues of NOK819.73 million in the three months ended 31st December 2015, compared to NOK 67.57 million on NOK 757.24 million in Q4 2014.  Its harvested volume was up at 6,806 tonnes in Q4 2015 from 5,261 tonnes in Q4 2014 (Q3: 6,206; Q2: 3,675; Q1: 6,283).  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The news came after the Sydney-based group posted a AUD 1.27 billion hit on asset revaluations.  The AFR citied Merrill Lynch to claim MIG needs to refinance around AUD 4.90 billion of debt by 2013.  The group, which owns the M6 toll road in the UK, has nine assets across Australia, North America and Europe.   It has taken a hit on the value of these assets but yesterday highlighted its solid balance sheet, and the fact it has secured refinancing on AUD 1.80 billion of debt for two of its roads.  Australian Broadcasting Corporation quoted John Hughes, chief executive of MIG, as saying: “All our refinancing requirements are managed well ahead of schedule with our lenders, and we don't have a requirement to raise new equity today.”  The group has no corporate-level debt and less than 15.0 per cent of its portfolio obligations are due in the next three-and-a-half years.  Shares in MIG lost 0.4 per cent of their value yesterday, and it closed with a market cap of AUD 3.26 billion.  In the year to 30th June 2008, net earnings were down 54.9 per cent at AUD 767.27 million.  Revenue fell by a third to AUD 1.33 billion, and the economic crisis further reduced the volume of traffic on MIG’s roads in the six months to December.

       " \"US antifriction bearings manufacturer Timken revealed it is in advanced discussions regarding the potential sale of its needle roller bearings business.  The disclosure comes after the Nikkei reported on Sunday Jtekt, a Japanese multibillion auto component corporation, is to buy the business for between JPY 30.00 billion (USD 315.78 million) and JPY 40.00 billion.   This article claimed the two firms have reached a basic understanding and a deal could be announced by the end of the month.  However, Ohio-headquartered Timken stressed that although negotiations are at an advanced stage nothing has been decided – it did not identify the suitor.  It said: “The company has not yet reached a definitive agreement regarding the sale. There can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be reached, or that a sale, which would be subject to certain closing conditions, will be 1.”  Timken claims to be one of the world's leading producers of highly engineered antifriction bearings and related products to companies active in sectors such as aerospace, construction, industrial equipment and power generation, among others.  The group has operations in 26 countries on six continents and employs around 25,000 people, according to its website.  It is to release its second quarter results for 2009 on 29th July. In the first quarter of 2009 the continuing global downturn negatively impacted sales – which declined by a third year-on-year to USD 960.38 million from USD 1.43 billion in Q1 2008.  Net profit was USD 0.87 million, 99.0 per cent lower than USD 84.47 million in Q1 2008.  Timken said: “Lower first quarter earnings reflect decreased demand across most of the company’s market sectors and the timing impact of the company’s material surcharge recovery mechanism.”  As at 31st March the group had cash and cash equivalents of USD 112.00 million and total debt was USD 630.0 million – or 28.1 per cent of capital. Net debt was USD 518.30 million as at 31st March, compared with USD 507.50 million as of 31st December 2008.  Shares in Timken finished at USD 20.41 on 27th July, up 1.2 per cent from USD 20.16 on 24th July, to give a market value of USD 1.98 billion.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

It began to suffer a sharp decline in earnings a year later, with pre-tax profit down 44.9 per cent from GBP 253.76 million to GBP 139.81 million in the 12 months to 31st December 2005 and more than halving in 2006 to GBP 46.37 million.  Net earnings plunged 90.4 per cent from GBP 251.12 million to GBP 24.02 million between 2004 and 2007.   Linpac has filed no further records with Companies House since this time but claims annual revenue of GBP 1.10 billion on its website.  Lenders will take it on as a going concern, Reuters sources said, suggesting debt will be reduced by GBP 320.00 million to around half of its current level.  Earlier in the month people with knowledge of the matter told the news provider Linpac is set for a cash injection of over GBP 50.00 million from lenders.  When Montagu bought the firm six years ago HSBC provided an equity bridge and Deutsche Bank supplied debt and mezzanine financing.  The business, formed in 1959 as Lincolnshire Packaging, employs 8,100 people, its website says.  It works from 90 locations on five continents with clients ranging from manufacturers of fishing tackle to carmakers.   The business has diversified into a number of areas including the production of plastic packaging for food, returnable transit packaging and rigid containers, as well as recycling, asset management and radio frequency identification.

The backer, which is an affiliate of alternative asset manager GLG Partners, is selling global depository receipts comprising a quarter of the ultra-high-grade (UHG) anthracite producer’s share capital.   JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Raiffeisen Bank International and Sberbank CIB are acting as global coordinators and bookrunners to the offering, of which 20.0 per cent is reserved for existing shareholders of GLG.  Chief executive Dmitry Shatokhin noted the proposed IPO gives prospective investors a chance to gain exposure to the highly attractive and steadily expanding anthracite market.  Sibanthracite is billed as a leading UHG producer with a strong and achievable growth profile supported by extensive reserves in Russia’s Novosibirsk region.  The group has five exploration licences at the coal fields of Gorlovsky, Urgunsky, Severny, Krutihinsky and Vostochny. According to its website, its overall resources had 351.60 million tonnes as of 1st April 2013.  Clients range from Glencore International and Metalimex to Vale, Arcelor Mittal and ThyssenKrupp.  Sibanthracite generated revenue of USD 508.00 million in fiscal 2012 (FY 2011: USD 399.00 million; FY 2010: USD 223.00 million) and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of USD 194.00 million (FY 2011: USD 168.00 million; FY 2010: USD 77.00 million).  Net profit has steadily increased over the last three years to USD117.00 million (FY 2011: USD 96.00 million; FY 2010: USD 37.00 million) while net profit margin rose from 17.0 per cent in FY 2010 to 23.0 per cent in FY 2012.  Anthracite is an extremely pure form of coal with a wide range of industrial applications but due to the specific conditions required to create it, high quality deposits are found only in a small number of countries, according to the statement.   China, Vietnam, Russia and Ukraine are the largest producers, with smaller industries in South Africa, US, Spain, Germany and the UK.  The steel industry uses anthracite either for pulverised coal injection in blast furnaces or ore-agglomeration.  Elsewhere, it is used in ferroalloys production and non-ferrous industries, in lime kilns for soda ash as an input in the glass-making process, making cement, in sugar refining and other applications.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The Sydney-headquartered mineral developer will sell a 51.0 per cent interest in Akara Mining through an initial public offering on Thailand’s stock exchange, the newspaper said without saying where it got the information.  The AFR added the company is hoping the partial float will fetch between USD 400.00 million and USD 600.00 million so proceeds can be funnelled back into M&A opportunities – making acquisitions outside Thailand.   Managing director Gavin Thomas, cited by the AFR, said yesterday the proposed market debut is “a good strategic move to try to diversify in a geopolitical manner”.  Kingsgate, through its Thai subsidiary Akara Mining, operates the Chatree gold project in central Thailand, 280 kilometres north of Bangkok.  The company claims the property is the country’s first modern gold mine.  It started mining the reserve in November 2001 with a processing plant capacity of 1.00 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), which was later expanded to 2.00 mtpa in 2006.  Shares in Kingsgate closed 9.9 per cent higher on 10th June at AUD 9.55 (USD 8.33), from USD 8.69 on 9th June, after the explorer announced it has received approval to expand its Chatree north gold production facility.   The green light means the new plant will be a separate 2.70 million tonne per annum ore processing site built alongside the current 2.30 million tonnes per annum facility.   This will lift combined total ore production capacity to more than 5.00 million tonnes per year.

Shigenobu Nagamori told the Financial Times (FT) he is “keen to pursue” both purchases and there have been some discussions in the past.  The electronics entrepreneur spoke to Bosch chief executive Franz Fehrenbach in 2008, some years after sounding out GE officials, Nagamori said.   Neither of these meetings produced the desired result and Fehrenbach rejected the idea of divesting its electric motor division.  Kyoto-based Nidec, which was worth JPY 587.46 billion (USD 7.30 billion) in 2010 revenue, currently makes small electric motors used in hard drives and domestic appliances.  It specialises in brushless motors, which can cut energy bills by a third compared to conventional motors, Nagamori told the FT.  The target businesses make more powerful parts used in cars and factory machinery, as well as household appliances.   Nagamori is looking to apply his firm’s brushless background to the targets’ knowledge of larger motors and believes the combination could result in less energy being used by the air conditioning, refrigeration and auto industries.  GE has around 125 years of experience in making electric motors and produces units that can generate anything up to 100,000 horsepower.  Bosch specialises in starter motors and generators for commercial vehicle and passenger cars, including hybrids.

Its last foray into the mergers and acquisitions arena was in 2008, when it bought Tengpani Tea in an all-stock deal worth around INR 7.49 million (USD 120,353) based on its market price at the time.  Gillanders Arbuthnot was founded as a partnership firm in the early 19th century between F Gillanders and G Arbuthnot and in the 20th century became part of the Kothari group of companies.

Tony Fernandes, chief executive of Asia’s largest low-cost airline, told reporters in Sydney today he believes an initial public offering (IPO) of the unit will make it more transparent.  He said in light of the fatal crash a listing seems like a good option to open the Indonesian carrier to closer scrutiny and make it more accountable.  Fernandes’ statement follows a report by the Malaysian Reserve newspaper in July that the planned share sale had been pulled due to disappointing financial results.  Flight 8501 was en route to Singapore from Indonesia on 28th December when it disappeared from radar screens after the pilot had requested permission to climb to a higher altitude due to difficult weather conditions.   More than 100 bodies of the 162 passengers on board the plane have been recovered from the Java Sea where the aircraft went down, but the search for remaining 60 is likely to end within days, Fernandes told the press conference in Sydney.  He said AirAsia would make one more attempt to find the last few victims over the next seven to ten days, but after that the operation will probably draw to a close.   Malaysia’s air industry had a miserable year in 2014, with the crash of Malaysia Airlines’ flight 370 in March closely followed by the suspected shooting down of flight 17 in eastern Ukraine in July.  AirAsia has already successfully listed one of its units, after an IPO by long haul business AirAsia X in 2013.  Plans to float the group’s Indonesian and Thai carriers have been ongoing for a number of years, as part of a strategy to separate out some of its regional operations to achieve greater value.  At one point AirAsia had got as far as appointing advisors to handle a proposed sale of a 20.0 per cent stake to raise USD 200.00 million, but constant delays and a poor set of financial results in fiscal 2013 meant an IPO has yet to get off the ground.     © Zephus Ltd',\n",

New investor Google Capital, which only came on board last month, is expected to remain a shareholder following the transaction.  Renaissance was founded in 1984 by husband-and-wife team Judi and Terry Paul in the basement of their Wisconsin home, and they remained the company’s majority owners for years later, even after they floated the business on the stock market in 1996.  The premise of the firm’s offering is to collect data from thousands of schools throughout the US to help teachers track students’ progress over an extended period of time, with around 30.0 per cent of the country’s institutions using the software.  TechCruch observed the first product back in the 1980s was an application for developing reading skills and, while this is still core to the company’s portfolio, it has since expanded into other subjects as well.  According to Renaissance’s website, over 400 studies have proved its technology to be effective, of which 70.0 per cent were conducted by third-parties.  Permira took the company private for USD 496.24 million in 2011, foiling three attempts by rival funds HarbourVest Partners and Thoma Bravo.  Since then, it has grown both organically and inorganically, including the acquisition of Subtext Media in June 2013.

ABN Amro, JPMorgan, Barclays, BNP Paribas and HSBC are acting as joint bookrunners for the transaction.   GrandVision is billed as a global leader in optical retail and operates in 43 countries worldwide, including China, Peru, Turkey, the UK, Germany and Italy.

Bimbo revealed discussions with Dunedin Holdings, a subsidiary of Canada’s George Weston, and said it could acquire the division’s fresh baked goods arm in the US.  The Mexican firm, which already operates in North America, gave no further details and warned “there can be no assurances that any transaction will occur as a result of these discussions”.  Toronto-based George Weston leads its domestic market for food distribution and is responsible for the Thomas’, Entenmann’s and Brownberry brands.  In fiscal 2007 the firm blamed commodity cost pressures for a “challenging” year – a factor which has accelerated throughout 2008.   However, its US brands Arnold and Thomas’ managed to increase sales during the 12-month period.  The group has been evaluating strategic and cost reduction initiatives for some time, with particular attention being paid to its manufacturing, distribution and administrative functions.  Last year George Weston posted a 2.3 per cent sales increase to CAD 33.034 billion (GBP 17.78 billion).  It clawed back net earnings after an 89.8 per cent plunge in 2006 (FY 2007: CAD 506.00 million; FY 2006: CAD 67.00 million; FY 2005: CAD 659.00 million).  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Shares in the Saville Row tailor have been suspended from trading pending clarification on its financial position, the company said.  It was relying heavily on its major shareholder, Arev Brands, to bail it out of trouble but was denied the funding needed at the last moment. The company is now considering different options, which may involve going down the administration route.  The Financial Times quoted chairman Andrew Manders as saying: \"Either we find someone to buy the business as a whole or to buy a stake, or someone to inject more funds into the business.\"  Shares closed on 25th September at 1.25 pence, the same price they had been trading at since 12th September. The group is listed on the Alternative Investment Market.  While the menswear range appeared to make good progress in FY 2007 the womenswear did not fare so well to the extent that Hardy Amies decided to scale it back.  Despite its best attempts, the group trading loss for the year, after taxation, was GBP 1.69 million (FY 2006: GBP 1.99 million). Revenue for FY 2007 increased 34.4 per cent to GBP 1.64 million from GBP 1.22 million. Hardy made a loss before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation for 2007 of GBP 1.12 million.

       " 'India’s Tata Global Beverages (TGB) is planning to raise USD 200.00 million from selling a minority stake in UK-based Tetley Tea to private equity investors.  A source with knowledge of the matter told the Economic Times (ET) that Rothschild has been given a mandate to “unlock value” from TGB’s global businesses “through restructuring and stake sales”.  “As the first step, its UK subsidiary Tetley could sell a minority stake of around 12.0 per cent to private equity players,” this person said.  TGB, then known as Tata Tea, bought the Uxbridge-based business for GBP 444.00 million in 2000 via a UK subsidiary, providing an exit for PPM Ventures and Schroder Ventures.  The Indian group generates 70.0 per cent of its revenue outside the domestic market and is moving its headquarters from Kolkata to Uxbridge.   It holds strong positions both in the UK and the US with tea, coffee and bottled water brands, including Grand, Mr Bean and Good Earth.  The group has designs on new categories and regions, so it will be looking for cash to finance acquisitions. Particular areas of interest are food and health drinks, such as herbal teas and water.  Tetley makes black, red bush and green tea, plus earl grey, peppermint and chamomile tea.  It was worth GBP 238.00 million in revenue last year after an annual increase of 5.1 per cent (FY 2008: GBP 226.40 million; FY 2007: GBP 210.90 million; FY 2006: GBP 207.60 million).  It has struggled to maintain earnings growth in recent years but after recording a GBP 14.14 million pre-tax loss in 2001 has remained profitable throughout the decade. Last year Tetley recorded pre-tax earnings of GBP 142.90 million, down 57.5 per cent from GBP 225.00 million in 2008.  With tea margins shrinking and global consumption decreasing, TGB can better deploy its assets in the growing heath and wellness segment, analysts told the ET.

This person, who did not wish to be identified as they are not authorised to speak publicly about the matter, said the discussions were at a very early stage.  They added there is still a chance the talks could collapse without a deal being reached.  Neither company has commented on the report.  Just a few days ago Ten released a statement warning shareholders that it expects television revenue to drop by between 3.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent in fiscal 2014.  However, it is not all bad news; the company said recent ratings have improved, largely due to the launch of its Masterchef Australia and Offspring programmes and as such, television earnings should increase in future as a consequence.  Ten claims to be one of Australia’s leading entertainment and news content firms, with a presence in the free-to-air TV, online and digital sectors.  In addition to the newly-launched programming mentioned previously, the company’s output includes current affairs show the Project, as well as reality programming such as the Bachelor Australia and international shows like Modern Family, 24 and the Graham Norton Show.

The news sent its share up from its previous close of 772.5p on Monday to a high of 806.5p in early trading. The stock was trading 3.50 per cent up at 799.5p at the time of publication.  Warrington-based United Utilities\\' principal activities are managing and operating the regulated electricity distribution, water and wastewater networks in North West England, a region with a population of around 7 million. As well as operating its water, wastewater and electricity networks in the North West, the group also uses its core utility skills to manage other infrastructure assets, through its United Utilities Contract Solutions business.  United Utilities Electricity owns the distribution network which carries electricity from the National Grid along power lines to consumers\\' premises on behalf of the electricity supply companies who are United Utilities Electricity\\'s customers. Customers receive their electricity bill from supply companies such as Powergen and British Gas who pay United Utilities for use of the electricity distribution network. It currently manages and operates 60,000km of overhead lines and underground cables, and 32,000 substations cover 12,000 square kilometres in the North West of England.  Preliminary results for the fiscal year ending March 2007 show that the company increased its revenues from continuing operations to GBP 2,323 million, a 11.36 per cent increase over last year\\'s GBP 2,086 million. Profit before tax from continuing operations saw a healthy 52 per cent increase to GBP 676 million, and basic earnings per share from continuing operations also increased from 37.8p last year to 57.1p. Total liabilities and debt currently stands at GBP 9,526.4 million, up from GBP 8,665.5 million.  In August 2000 United Utilities sold its electricity and gas supply business and this move should allow it to focus even closer on its water asset base.  The distribution assets have a value of around GBP 1.1 billion and could sell for up to GBP 1.3 billion as should not be a shortage of suitors. Analysts have been slow on the uptake in naming any potential suitors. The company sold its UK customer service operation, Vertex Data Science, this year to a consortium of US-based private equity firms led by Oak Hill Capital Partners for GBP 217.5 million and both private equity groups and international infrastructure funds won\\'t be too far from the head of the queue.',\n",

At the time analysts suggested the name of Emerson as a likely bidder, along with Eaton Corporation and Schneider Electric of France.  Trading in Chloride\\'s stock spiked as the market opened on Monday, forcing it to release a response to the speculation at 9:41am.

On that basis, I thought if the game’s going to change let’s drive it,” Pindar told the publication.  He added: \"You either plan your pathway forward or sit and watch everything drift away. We have decided to take this course of action.\"  PrintWeek noted that prospective bidders, which include suitors from the continent and North America, are to submit indicative proposals ahead of the 6th July deadline.  Pindar, who has received an OBE for services to business and within the Scarborough community, told the industry magazine: \"Having made the decision we decided to make this a rapid process as we didn’t want it to drag on.   “People who are investors can see there’s an investable business here and we’re expecting to receive a number of bids during the week.”  Pindar traces its roots to 1836 when journeyman printer George Kyte Grice established a business in Scarborough.

The Australian, without saying where it got the information, reported that the Victoria-based suitor has confirmed interest in the auction process but declined to comment on the recent negotiations.  A spokesman, cited by the Wall Street Journal, stated: “The company is always assessing acquisition opportunities.”  In May last year Caltex Australia entered into an agreement to acquire Exxon Mobil’s 302 service stations in the country for AUD 300.00 million (GBP 181.42 million) – subject to review and clearance from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Foreign Investment Review Board.   Last month the fuel supplier announced it had been barred by the competition authorities from buying the petrol distribution network, paving the way for another suitor to come forward with a bid.  The Australian noted that a deal will be valued lower than the AUD 300.00-million-price tag attached to the Caltex agreement.  No further information on the proposed acquisition has been revealed but a spokesman for Exxon Mobil told Bloomberg by telephone that the Texan firm is looking into options for its retail fuel business.  In an interview yesterday, Exxon Mobil Australia’s chairman John Dashwood told Bloomberg the company is keen to focus on natural-gas projects, with plans to spend “many billions of dollars” in Australia and Papua New Guinea in three to five years.

Within the albumin segment in China, the group is the second-largest domestic manufacturer with a 5.8 per cent market share, and is second within the IVIG category domestically with 15.5 per cent, based on production volumes.

Whether or not this is a coincidence remains to be seen, but Barclay\\'s intentions towards the Chongqing trust have been public since May and if the deal goes ahead it will secure Barclays\\' place as the first overseas bank with a stake in a Chinese trust company.  It had hoped to exceed the 19.9 per cent stake approved by the China Banking Regulatory Commission, though it will have to settle for the position of pioneer and hope that Beijing lifts its cap on foreign investment, after which time a 50 per cent stake could become available to Barclays.  \"The deal will allow Barclays to offer wealth management services and financial derivative products to Chinese clients through New China Trust\\'s licences and network,\" a sources told Reuters.  A stake in New China Trust will afford Barclays, the fourth-largest banking firm in the world according to its tier one capital, access to the trust\\'s board. It will become the group\\'s second shareholder, after a Chinese investment firm which has a 50 per cent stake, the news provider said.  At present, through its own investment banking arm, Barclays Capital, the UK financial services provider has a presence in Beijing and Shanghai, while it has yet to establish a commercial or retail banking footprint in the country.  With offices across Europe, the US, Australia, Asia, Africa, South America and the Middle East, Barclays specialises in banking, investment banking and asset management.     While the China Development Bank investment has allowed Barclays to up its offer for Dutch banking firm ABN Amro, if it does manage to take over the Amsterdam-based firm, Barclays will gain a platform to enter the Chinese commercial banking sector.   ABN Amro\\'s Shanghai corporate and intuitional banking office is undoubtedly appealing to a bank which has already expressed a preference for organic growth in China, though it will have to beat a Royal Bank of Scotland-led bid for the Dutch firm before that becomes a reality.   Neither Barclays nor New China Trust were available for comment.',\n",
       " 'Japanese capacitor maker Murata Manufacturing has agreed to purchase IPDiA, a France-headquartered producer of 3D silicon capacitor technology.  No financial details of the transaction, which is expected to complete before the end of October, have been disclosed at this time.  Murata believes the move will enable it to reinforce its core operations in the mobile communications field while expanding into the automotive and medical sectors.  The company is making the purchase through its Murata Electronics Europe subsidiary.  Commenting on the acquisition, Toru Inoue, executive vice president of the buyer’s components business unit, said: “Combining IPDiA’s 3D silicon capacitor technologies with Murata’s current technologies and product portfolio will enable us to expand our combined offering and meet our customers’ high reliability requirements, such as high temperature or high voltage, in automotive and other demanding markets.”  IPDiA chief executive Franck Murray added that the company will enhance its existing offering as a consequence of its new owner’s expertise.  The target claims to be a leading manufacturer of integrated passive devices and its customers include medical electronics and semiconductor players.  Murata has already been linked with another purchase this year; back in July the firm entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding to pick up the battery-related businesses of Japanese electronics giant Sony.  At the time the parties said a formal agreement was expected to be reached in mid-October, with completion slated to follow by the end of March 2017.  Kyoto-headquartered Murata claims to be a world leader in the design, manufacture and supply of advanced electronic materials and components, as well as multi-functional, high-density modules.  The company was founded in 1950 and now employs some 54,674 people.  Murata posted net sales of JPY 1,211 billion (USD 11.67 billion) in 2015, while operating income for the year totalled JPY 275.40 million.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Mauritius-registered Red Fort Capital Management Company intends to put upwards of INR 1.00 billion (GBP 13.53 million) into a special purpose vehicle that will own a residential property project in Uttar Pradesh, the Economic Times (ET) said today.  The real estate-focused private equity firm will get a 50.0 per cent interest in the holding company and will invest up to INR 1.30 billion, the paper said, citing sources it did not identify.   3C Company is set to develop the land – some 41 acres in Noida – under the project name Lotus Panache.   It claims the site will be India’s largest green residential project, and development plans include Asia’s first zero-energy geothermal nursery school.   The ET anticipates between 350,000 and 400,000 apartments will be built at Lotus Panache.  It said investment from Red Fort and 3C will only cover the purchase of the land; acquisitions from individual property buyers would finance construction.   A cash injection by Red Fort, which has already made a number of purchases in India and invested in another 3C development, could signal a recovery for the country’s property industry, the ET noted. The paper suggested “buyers are slowly returning”.  In August last year, VC Circle said the private equity business provided INR 1.50 billion for 3C’s Lotus Boulevard – also a 40-acre site in Noida in which it got a 50.0 per cent interest.   The group paid INR 900.00 million for a minority share in Delhi’s Parsvnath Developers in June 2009.  Its portfolio includes residential, commercial, logistics and hospitality investments.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The consideration will be fully settled by the issuance of 150.00 million new stocks in the buyer worth AUD 1.95 million (USD 1.50 million), including an additional AUD 975,000 earn-out if certain financial targets are achieved.  Closing is expected by 12th May 2015, subject to the completion of due diligence and the execution of a formal sale documentation, as well as shareholder and regulatory approvals.   In addition, Cohiba has announced a share placing and rights issue valued at AUD 1.44 million and AUD 515,260, respectively, to help finance exploration activities, transaction expenses related to an ongoing acquisition and working capital purposes.  Figtree-based Cobalt X is a proprietary company involved in the business of minerals exploration which has made applications for a number of mining licenses.   Victoria-headquartered Cohiba is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, with the primary focus of investing in the resource sector through direct tenement acquisition, joint ventures, farm in arrangements and new project generation.  The company’s stocks closed at AUD 0.03 yesterday, valuing the business at more than AUD 6.20 million.   In 2016, Cohiba purchased Australian lithium explorer Charge Lithium for around AUD 525,000, including a AUD 262,500 earn-out.  According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, there have been 265 deals targeting metal miners announced worldwide so far in 2017.  The largest of these was Shandong Tianye Group’s AUD 252.00 million agreement to buy Perth-based gold explorer Hanking Australia last week.  This was followed by UK-headquartered Randgold Resources’ GBP 95.41 million blocklisting earlier this month.

       " 'Sime Darby, one of Malaysia’s largest conglomerates, has tabled a cash offer to acquire New Britain Palm Oil (NBPL) for GBP 7.15 a share, which values the Papua New Guinea plantation operator at about GBP 1.07 billion.  The move comes after the Kuala Lumpur-based suitor decided not to proceed with the purchase of the stake held by Kulim, an agri-business group which tendered a partial offer for NBPL last year but was blocked by local regulator.  Flagged in June, Kulim intended to sell all or part of its 49.0 per cent holding in the target and selected Sime Darby as preferred buyer.  However, things did not go as smoothly as expected since the world’s top oil palm planter by land bank size gave up the chance to take a big chunk of NBPL, following the expiry of the exclusive negotiation period at the end of last month.  Apparently, Kulim’s stake could not satisfy Sime Darby’s hunger for sustainable palm oil as it aims to fully control the London-listed milling operator.   At GBP 7.15 apiece, the offer represents an 87.2 per cent premium over its closing price of GBP 3.82 apiece on 08th October, GBP 1.65 or 30.0 per cent higher than Kulim’s proposal last year.  Investors cheered the takeover by sending NBPL’s stock up 78.5 per cent from GBP 3.82 yesterday to GBP 6.82 at the time of writing.   Citigroup and Clifford Chance are advising Sime Darby on the purchase, which will be financed through existing resources and credit lines.   NBPL has over 78,000 hectares of planted oil palm plantations, more than 7,700 hectares of sugar cane and a further 9,200 hectares of grazing pasture, twelve oil mills as well as two refineries.   It also claims to be the largest domestic sugar and beef producer in Papua New Guinea.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'US engineering powerhouse Jacobs announced its second international transaction today, signing an option agreement with China’s Suzhou Han’s Chemical Engineering (SHCE) to add to its acquisition of a Brazilian company.  Despite the news, shares in the Californian group were trading down 1.4 per cent at USD 60.72 on Nasdaq this morning.  SHCE has two speciality class A licences in China’s chemical, petroleum and pharmaceutical (CPP) sector, enabling it to provide engineering design, procurement and project management services for all such undertakings there.  Jacobs noted that its own operation in Shanghai has an industry class B permit for the CPP segment and has 1 many programmes for global clients investing in the country.  If the US company went ahead and acquired SHCE it would add an engineering office in Suzhou in the Jiangsu province, and increase its workforce in China to more than 600, giving it the wherewithal to deliver a full complement of services for chemical and petrochemical projects.  Tom Quinn, Jacobs group vice president, stressed that the opportunity to buy the business would be a notable milestone in its growth strategy in the country.  He added: “And if the acquisition is successfully 1, it would further develop our service offerings to clients, strengthen our ability to compete for projects, and provide more opportunities for our employees.”  Aside from its Shanghai office, the Pasadena-headquartered group has locations in Beijing, Hong Kong, Nanjing and Shanghai.  Jacobs announced today that it is making its first inroads into Brazil by agreeing to purchase Rio de Janeiro-based engineering company Guimar Engenharia for an undisclosed sum.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " \"Taiwan-based Arima Computer Corporation is planning to sell its notebook PC and server business to Singapore's Flextronics International, according to media speculation.  Reuters said the two firms had signed a letter of intent on Thursday, though no announcement had been made on either website by midday.  If the deal goes ahead it could see Flextronics pay USD 191.5 million for loss-making Arima's laptop and server operations, its China-based unit, and its stakes in other divisions in Japan, North America and Europe, Reuters claimed. A formal contract is expected within the next 45 days.  The Taoyuan-based computer and peripherals maker has been operating with a negative net income since 2003 and saw its net loss increase 16.07 per cent last year to TWD 2.045 billion (GBP 30.787 million) from TWD 1.762 billion in 2005.  Specialising in the manufacture of notebooks, servers, internet appliances, set-top boxes, PDA displays, optoelectronics and communications products, Arima has a poor history of maintaining revenue streams, with sales down 18.7 per cent in 2006 to TWD 22.277 billion (FY 2005: TWD 27.393 billion; FY 2004: TWD 22.7 billion: FY 2003: TWD 28.88 billion).   Against this background, and with already negative margins shrinking further, it makes sense for Arima to sell part of its business.  The group is divisible into ten units - Arima Computer forms just one, with responsibility for notebook PC, server and industrial PC making - and has manufacturing, service and research and development facilities in Taiwan, China, Japan, Britain, Texas and California.   Valued at around TWD 8.929 billion in equity, the company's shares have taken a hit in recent years, falling from a record market capitalisation of TWD 14.461 billion in 2003. Investors will therefore be looking for a sign that Arima is trying to improve its prospects.   The group has been providing a negative return on shareholder funds for the last five years, with the situation worsening from -23.15 per cent in 2005 to -36.75 last year.  Given its financial history, a move from Arima to sell part of its operations seems not only logical, but essential.   © Zephus Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Mestdagh, the Belgian operator of the Champion supermarket chain, could be interested in purchasing groceries retailers from Carrefour as the French firm reveals a major retreat.  Citing Carrefour Belgium’s chief executive Gérard Lavinay, Bloomberg said 21 unprofitable outlets will be closed by June and privately-held Mestdagh might acquire between 17 and 20 more.  Carrefour’s sales in the country have declined for five consecutive years. It will slash its Belgian headcount by 11.0 per cent – making more than 1,600 people redundant – as well as cutting wages for those remaining as it tries to restore profit.  “Our cost structure in Belgium is too high,” Bloomberg cited Lavinay as saying. “However, it doesn’t make sense to lower your cost base if you don’t have a plan for a commercial strategy at the same time.”  The news provider said half of Carrefour Belgium’s 56 out-of-town hypermarkets were unprofitable in 2009. Sales were 2.9 per cent lower year-on-year.  Citing AC Nielsen, it said Delhaize Group overtook the French firm as Belgium’s largest food retailer in the second quarter.  Gosselies-based Mestdagh was worth EUR 424.94 million in 2008 sales and managed to increase revenue every year between 2002 and 2008.   However, 2008 brought an end to two successive years of earnings growth as net profit plunged 38.5 per cent to EUR 7.51 million from EUR 12.20 million in 2007.  The group’s chief Eric Mestdagh told the Belga news agency: “I confirm I am interested in buying stores [from Carrefour Belgium], if there are stores to be bought.”  However, he cautioned that a deal may not happen and said talks have not yet started.  “I would be very happy if Gérard Lavinay would telephone me about this,” he added, noting that his group had tried to make a similar move in 2007.  According to Trends, Mestdagh is interested in Carrefour outlets in Brussels and Flanders.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'China-based chemical systems engineering and technology provider Anchun International will launch an initial public offering (IPO) in Singapore to boost its profile among stock market players, paving the way to future investment.  While a prospectus has been filed with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, details regarding the listing are still sketchy at best, though it is known that Kim Eng Corporate has been hired as manager, underwriter and placement agent.  Proceeds from the IPO will be used to expand production facilities and capabilities, boost research and development (R&D) and will go towards the everyday running of the business.  Anchun may be registered in Singapore but its principal place of business is in the People’s Republic, providing chemical and engineering systems and technologies to China’s petrochemical and chemical industries, in particular, to manufacturers of ammonia and methanol-based products.  The group’s business is broadly categorised as: designing engineering systems; making chemical systems and components such as alcohol-hydrocarbon and ammonia synthesis reactor technology and pressure vessels; and producing oxidative and reductive catalysts.  It claims to have one of the largest R&D and manufacturing capabilities for ammonia and methanol related equipment in the country.  These systems are used by customers to produce ammonia and methanol, which, in turn, are used as feedstock to create downstream products such as urea, compound fertiliser, methanol fuel and explosives.  The company has an established base of around 320 clients across China; customers include China XLX Fertiliser, Shandong Hualu Hengsheng Chemical and Sinofert Holdings.  Anchun’s top line has steadily increased over the last three years up from CNY 114.78 million (USD 17.01 million) and CNY 121.01 million in fiscal 2007 and 2008, respectively, to CNY 294.84 million in 2009.

       " 'The awaited cash call from India’s Kingfisher Airlines will be a one-for-one rights issue to raise INR 4.00 billion (GBP 54.75 million), the Economic Times (ET) said today.  Talked about since July 2009, it is a move aimed at improving the Bangalore-based passenger carrier’s debt-equity ratio and will be arranged by SBI Capital, the paper said, citing sources familiar with the matter.  Shareholders might receive a discount of up to 70.0 per cent over current market prices, these people added. A company spokesperson would not comment when contacted by the ET.  Kingfisher’s stock finished 3.2 per cent lower at INR 50.45 yesterday, valuing the group at INR 13.41 billion. In the last three months the units have lost 6.9 per cent of their value.  Bankers have advised the company, which touts itself as India’s only five-star airline, to increase equity before it undertakes any other fundraising, the ET said, claiming the airline’s debt stands at INR 6.00 billion.   It need not be stated that these are testing times for the global aviation industry, with stalwarts such as British Airways having to partner with rivals to survive.  “The fact that the airline is zeroing in on the rights issue option to raise funds denotes that there is a feeling among promoters that the company is undervalued and [a] rights issue is the best way to pump equity into the airline,” a source told the paper.   “Also, it gives a chance to the promoters to mop up unsubscribed shares,” this person added.  The group’s promoters, including chairman Vijay Mallya, own a stake of two-thirds and would have to subscribe to INR 2.64 billion of the issue.  Earlier this month Kingfisher was granted traffic rights to operate on seven new international routes, linking New Delhi with London, Hong Kong and Bangkok, as well as Dubai and Colombo.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Citing a source with knowledge of the matter, the publication claimed negotiations are under way and could lead to Louis Dreyfus participating in a capital increase by mid January.  Le Figaro said the transaction is aimed at helping Mangas pay for the purchase of a 60.0 per cent stake in London-based online poker company Everest Gaming, which it agreed to buy on 16th December.  Mangas has been an aggressive M&A player in 2009, having also taken control of German and Swedish online gaming groups bet-at-home.com and Expekt in March.   It now ranks among the top three European internet gambling companies, with assets including France’s leading player in online sports betting Betclic and presence in the three core segments of sports betting, poker and casino.  Mangas is a joint venture between the Monaco casino operator Société des Bains de Mer (SBM) and Lov Group, a holding company belonging to the French television producer Stephane Courbit.  It operates in over 25 countries and as at the end of November 2009, claimed more than 4.00 million clients and a staff of around 600 people.  iGaming said it is unclear whether Louis Dreyfus would buy stock directly from SBM and/or Courbit, or whether these existing shareholders would have their stakes diluted by a capital increase.  A later report claimed the commodities, energy and real estate investor would buy a quarter of Mangas, with Courbit reducing his holding by the same amount.  The would-be buyer, which generated net earnings of EUR 1.61 billion last year, has already notified the European Commission of its intention and anticipates a decision next month, iGaming said.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The Times said group chief executive John Carroll is leading a joint bid with Canada’s Hunter family at a potential 20.00 pence per scrip.  Shares in Somerset-registered Travelzest, the owner of the UK’s largest naturist tour company Peng Travel, were up 15.8 per cent at the day’s high of 16.50 pence following the news.  An offer at 20.00 pence per unit would value the business at GBP 29.03 million and provide current investors with a 40.4 per cent mark-up.  In a disclosure to the London Stock Exchange, the firm said it is in “the very early stages of discussions over a potential offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of the company”.   “There is no certainty that the talks will result in an offer being made,” it cautioned.  Directors, employees and a shell company known as 7198914 Canada subscribed to more than 78.0 per cent of Travelzest in a private placement in 2009.   Little is known about the Canadian business, but it was established for the specific purpose of participating in this transaction.  Travelzest was a takeover target back in 2008 when it confirmed an approach from a potential buyer which was not named. Discussions at the time centred around a 25.0 per cent premium for shareholders, but nothing came of the talks.  The company owns a range of boutique travel firms which specialise in locations such as Morocco, Malaysia and Cuba.

       " \"Trieste-based Fincantieri Cantieri Navali Italiani, one of the world's largest shipbuilding companies, is considering a 2008 initial public offering, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.  A stock market debut would see the Italian state-owned company part-privatised, with funds being used for an ambitious growth plan, the publication said.  With sales valued at EUR 2.527 billion in 2006, and a 200-year history of manufacturing and repairing marine vessels, Fincantieri will have little difficulty proving its worth to investors.  However, revenue growth has been sluggish over recent years (FY 2005: EUR 2.316 billion; FY 2004: EUR 2.232 billion; FY 2003: EUR 2.388 billion), suggesting the need for Fincantieri to implement its expansion plan without delay.  Though the firm has sustained net earnings since 2000, increases have been less than impressive (FY 2006: EUR 52.448 million; FY 2005: EUR 51.107 million) and it has lost half its income since the EUR 101.121 million recorded in 2004.   With a poor history of generating income from sales (EUR 52.448 million from EUR 2.527 billion last month), it seems Fincantieri could benefit from the increases in operational efficiency associated with privatisation.  News of Fincantieri's IPO comes as East Asian rival China Shipbuilding Industry said it is planning to raise CNY 7 billion (EUR 681.87 million) from a domestic listing.  Global shipbuilding has seen an upward trend over recent years amid robust demand, with the China Daily claiming that profits among the country's marine vessel manufacturers were up 151 per cent in the first half of 2007.   Fincantieri operates in the cruise and ferries segment - in which it is a global leader - and has supplied vessels to P&O Cruises, Cunard Line, Carnival Cruise Lines and Sea Containers, among others. IPO funding will allow the firm to develop its yacht-making business.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

Meanwhile Bloomberg cited sources as saying a final decision has not been made on whether or not to proceed with an IPO.  Established in 1953, Gunung Sewu has interests spanning insurance, real estate, agriculture and consumer goods and employs about 25,000 people.  It operates one of the world’s largest integrated canned pineapple facilities and processes more than 500,000 tonnes of the fruit, with 11,000 containers of tinned produce exported to 60 countries.   Meanwhile, Gunung Sewu’s Yupi Indo jelly gum business produces 6.00 billion pieces annually, making it the biggest gummy candy maker in Southeast Asia.  In May 2014 Japan’s Nippon Life Insurance agreed to invest IDR 4,872 billion (USD 353.08 million at current exchange rates) for a 20.0 per cent stake in the group’s insurance arm Asuransi Jiwa Sequis Life.  Gunung Sewu did not respond to emails from Bloomberg seeking comment and nobody was available to give a response when contacted by phone.  An IPO by the conglomerate could give a much-needed boost to the Jakarta stock market, where listings have slowed against a backdrop of a sluggish economy.  The largest share offering so far this year was the USD 343.00 million debut by private hospital operator Mitra Keluarga in March, according to data from Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk.

According to the online version of the Times, Northern Foods is looking at buying the small manufacturer of fresh pasta, soups and sauces that was put up for sale at the end of last month.  Pasta Reale, which specialises in supplying own-label brands to major retailers such as Morrisons, is believed to have appointed Grant Thornton to explore trade sale options back in January.  The manufacturer is the market leader in the UK's chilled pasta sector and also produces gravies and stocks. Founded in 1979 by Salvatore Lopalco - along with his wife Virginia and his brother-in-law Roberto Santi - Pasta Reale is still owned by the family.  After employing Grant Thornton to explore ownership options it appears that Lopalco is ready to exit. Although Northern Foods has so far refused to comment, this is the sort of bolt-on acquisition that it tends to favour.   Despite being famous for its own brands such as Fox's mints, Goodfella's pizzas, Holland's Pies and Dalepak, Northern Foods also produces supermarket own-labelled products.   The company focuses on the premium tiers in retailer own-brand ranges - such as Finest, Extra Special or The Best - and currently its brand and own-label split is approximately 60:40. Sales to its top five customers (Asda, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and market leader Tesco) represent around 76 per cent of total revenue.  Pasta Reale generated revenues of GBP 30.445 million during the 12 months leading up to September 30th 2006. From these sales the company generated profit before tax of GBP 919,000 and profit after tax of GBP 784,000, equating to a profit margin of 3.02 per cent.  Its reported suitor announced a strategic review in May 2006 after falling to a GBP 5 million net loss during the 2005/2006 finical year from total sales of GBP 1.44 billion. The following year revenues fell 38.2 per cent and the company posted a net loss of GBP 22.5 million, although its profit margin widened from -1.12 per cent to 3.86 per cent in fiscal 2007.

German discount store Adli first opened its stores in Poland in February 2008 and an acquisition of the Lidl stores would help the company establish a quick foothold in the competitive Polish market.  International French retailer Auchan also has operations in Poland with a total of 21 hypermarkets, 18 of which are wholly owned with the remainder owned by a joint venture between Auchan and the Schiever group.

The reports emerged in local newspaper Negocio and suggested that the Spanish group was preparing a EUR 800 million bid.  InfoSpace's shares were up by USD 4.20 (13.17 per cent) to close at USD 23.30 yesterday.  InfoSpace is a developer of tools and technologies that assist consumers with finding content and information on the Internet or mobile phone. The company uses its technology, including metasearch, to power its own branded Websites (such as www.dogpile.com and www.zoo.com, a child-friendly search engine) and provide private-label online search and directory services to distribution partners. In addition, its mobile applications provide programming and sales opportunities to the company's mobile carrier partners, while providing consumers with relevant mobile functionality and mobile media content, including ringtones, graphics and games.   The company operates through two business units: Online, which comprises the company's search and directory properties, as well as its private label distribution service, and Mobile services, including portal, storefront, messaging and mobile search. The company's sales are split virtually 50/50 between the two business lines with its Online business accounting for 50.28 per cent and its Mobile segment the remaining 49.72 per cent.  Turnover for 2006 improved slightly from the previous year's figures of USD 339.968 million to hit USD 371.737 million but net income dropped dramatically from USD 159.368 million to a net loss of USD 15.088 million. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization stood at negative USD 44.711 million. In April the company announced that revenues for the first quarter of 2007 were USD 86.6 million, reflecting a USD 3.6 million or 4 per cent decrease over the first quarter of 2006. Net loss for the first quarter of 2007 was USD 0.5 million or USD 0.02 per share versus net income of USD 3.0 million or USD 0.09 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2006. The company's expects revenues to be down this year and GAAP net loss to be between USD 4 million and USD 5 million as mobile media revenues declined as expected.  After losing a major account and seeing the unit record net losses, InfoMedia is attempting to reduce and eventually exit its mobile media business.  Stacy Ybarra, a spokeswoman for InfoSpace said it was the company's policy not to comment on market speculation.  The consideration mentioned in the reports has been an area of contention for analysts who deem the company to be valued at around USD 800 million, not EUR 800 million. The company's market cap based on yesterday's close is USD 707 million (EUR 525.6 million) and the company is debt-free. Such a premium seems surprising considering it is currently restructuring and is in a challenging position with a lack of cash flow.   An offer may indeed be on the horizon but it will be surprising if it is not made at a more realistic price.\",\n",

While risk scoring is commonplace in the West it is still a new concept in the People’s Republic, despite being the world’s second-largest economy.  “Chinese shoppers are hungry for convenient, reliable and fair credit channels,” according to JD Finance chief executive Shegqiang Chen.  “This requires both a systematic method for making decisions and a robust infrastructure that enables lenders to share data – neither of which is sufficiently developed yet in China.”  He noted the tie-up with ZestFinance is a major step toward implementing a system that will help meet huge market need and aims to create a one-stop service for the country’s consumers to make all of their daily purchases.  Chinese lenders lack the data used in established markets to determine risk, as shoppers often have little or no credit history.  ZestFinance’s big data platform analyses tens of thousands of data points to make a decision and is particularly suitable for the country because it accurately underwrites people without any history.  Earlier this year, Alibaba’s finance arm launched a credit rating system that draws on the ecommerce giant’s huge stockpile of user data.  Sesame Credit Management was formed in response to a government push to expand lending to consumers and businesses.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'German semiconductor manufacturer Infineon is in discussions with its US rival Intel over a potential sale of its wireless chip division, the German business daily Financial Times (FT) Deutschland reported.  Sources familiar with the matter told the newspaper that while the Californian giant is extremely keen to buy the unit, the Munich-headquartered firm is unsure whether a divestment makes sense after completing a successful restructuring programme.  Chief executive officer Peter Bauer in particular is opposed to a sale, despite Infineon taking a EUR 623.00 million hit in the financial year ended 30th September 2009.  FT Deutschland reported that Intel has been looking to boost its presence in the mobile chip market for a while now, making Infineon’s division especially attractive as it makes single-chip and multimedia baseband platforms for 3G and 2G and designs protocol stack and application framework software, among other things.  Neither firm was immediately available for to comment when contacted by the newspaper.  Shares in Infineon climbed 3.5 per cent to an intra-day of EUR 5.22 on the report before paring gains to trade up 1.3 per cent at EUR 5.11 by 3.19 pm local time today.  The corporation is focused on offering semiconductors and systems for automotive and industrial electronics, chip card and security applications, as well as for use in the communications market.  Infineon claims to be the number one chip supplier to the automotive industry, providing products such as sensors, microcontrollers and power semiconductors. The company has a global presence, operating through subsidiaries in California in the US, in Singapore in the Asia-Pacific region and in Tokyo, Japan.

The paper quoted managing director Suresh Krishna as saying the company is currently in talks with two or three backers, but could still opt to borrow the money from banks. The total amount has not yet been finalised.  Krishna said the capital would be used to invest in three projects, which are valued at INR 5.00 billion. Two of the developments are located in Chennai, with another in Coimbatore.  Isha Homes has delivered more than 0.30 million square feet of residential space since being established in 2004, and has more than 0.70 million square feet currently under construction. It claims to specialise in green, technologically-advanced builds.  1 projects include apartments and houses in Chennai and Pallikaranai, Tamil Nadu. Its Signature Villa development is a gated community with amenities covering 10.0 acres of land. Less extensive sites include terraced housing and units of fewer than 10 flats.  The company is currently working on Isha Yara, an apartment complex with 444 homes, each measuring 801.00 to 1,211.0 square feet. Business Standard said the second phase of work has just been announced, and quoted Krishna as putting a value of INR 1.45 million on the build.

       " 'Marshall Islands-incorporated petroleum and chemicals transporter Ardmore Shipping is rolling out plans to dilute its equity capital by way of an initial public offering (IPO) in the US worth roughly USD 160.00 million.  The private equity-backed seaborne carrier, which has its principal executive offices in Ireland, has hired Morgan Stanley, Jefferies and Clarkson Capital Markets to handle the listing on the New York Stock Exchange.   Proceeds will be used to pay for an initial fleet of 12 vessels, including eight in operation and four on order with deliveries expected to start in January 2014, and to fund expansion by acquiring a further 12 ships.  Ardmore started business in April 2010 through its predecessor with a goal of building an enduring product and chemical tanker company with a low-cost structure, financial flexibility and an attractive, fuel-efficient portfolio.  The company, which is backed by Greenbrier Equity, has limited operating history and generated revenue of USD 25.17 million in the financial year ended 31st December 2012 (FY 2011: USD 22.38 million) and incurred a net loss of USD 4.54 million for the period (FY 2011: USD 2.98 million loss).  According to information provided by Drewry Maritime Research citied in IPO prospectus lodged with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the global shipping downturn is entering its sixth year and several sectors, including products and chemicals, are showing signs of a recovery.  The outlook for product tankers is positive, with overall demand growth estimated at 3.9 per cent in 2013 and that for supply, net of scrapping, for mid-size ships forecast at 2.8 per cent for the full year.   This business segment has been bolstered by secular trends, including refinery shut-downs, increasing complexity of trade and regulatory initiatives.  Similarly, the outlook for chemical tankers is also encouraging, with demand growth estimated at 3.6 per cent and supply, net of scrapping, estimated at 1.6 per cent in 2013.  According to the prospectus, this segment is being driven by continued development of emerging economies and may benefit significantly in the medium-term by shifting trade patterns caused by low-price chemical feedstock resulting from shale gas activities in North America.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Norske Skogindustrier (Norske Skog), a Norwegian papermaker, said on Monday it is evaluating the possibility of selling off its mills in China.  The Lysaker-based company, which claims to be leading producer of newsprint and magazine paper with 16 paper mills around the world, is looking into reducing its net debt.  One option being considered to pay down obligations is a divestment of assets, not just operations in China. The asset value of the mills in the People’s Republic was written down by NOK 498.00 million (GBP 50.08 million) in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Norske Skog’s interest-bearing net debt increased over Q4 2008 (mainly due to a weaker Norwegian kroner) and stood at NOK 14.05 billion as at 31st December 2008.  It reported gearing of 1.05 per cent as at 31st December 2008 – increased from 0.89 at the end of Q3 2008.  “Preliminary processes have been started, but at this stage there is nothing concrete to report,” Norske Skog said in response to South China Morning Post speculating on the sale of the mills.  Citing sources, the news provider said the Scandinavian firm is trying to sell its mainland newsprint business to Chinese companies such as Shandong Chenming Paper Holdings and Shandong Huatai Paper.  Analyst Kenneth Sivertsen at Arctic Securities told Reuters: \"For Norske Skog it may be reasonable to pull out (of China) considering its upcoming debt for 2010 and 2011.”  He went on to say: “If they get a reasonable price for the two mills in China, this is positive for the shares.”  Shares traded 0.3 per cent lower at NOK 16.20 at 12.17 CET (9th February: NOK 16.25) and the group has lost 43.9 per cent of its value over the last year (8th February 2008: NOK 28.90).  Norske Skog has already sold its Korean newsprint subsidiary Norske Skog Korea to Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia and Shinhan Private Equity for NOK 4.30 billion.   Sivertsen told Reuters it is unlikely that a sale of the Chinese assets will bring in as much as its Korean operations.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'UK supermarket chain Morrisons is considering an approach for Ocado, the online groceries retailer, according to the Daily Mail.  Without citing its sources, the UK paper said the firm could make a bid valued at more than GBP 1.00 billion.  The companies had already been linked with a potential licensing tie-up, with Bradford-headquartered Morrisons possibly licencing some of Ocado’s intellectual property and operating knowledge to enable it to launch its own online grocery business domestically.  Both parties are expected to benefit and reinforce their existing operations in the growing sector.  However, the Daily Mail’s report said the UK’s fourth-largest supermarket chain could decide to go with a takeover instead.  The paper stated a transaction could enable the company to strengthen its online presence, an area where it has fallen behind competitors such as Tesco and Sainsbury, and has also felt discount peers such as Aldi snapping at its heels.  However, the deal’s consideration may be determined by Stuart Rose, who is due to take over as chairman of Ocado on the 10th May and according to the Daily Mail, is unlikely to approve a sale at a low price.  No details of when a completion can be expected have been disclosed at this time.  Ocado is headquartered in Hatfield and was founded in April 2000 by Time Steiner, Jason Gissing and Jonathan Faiman.  The company initially traded as LM Solutions, but changed its name in June 2001 and has been operating under its current moniker ever since.  It now delivers more than 18,000 orders every day on average more than 27.00 million since 2002, counting more than 70.0 per cent of British households among its customer base.  Morrisons has over 400 stores and employs 132,000 people.  The firm’s history dates back to 1899, when egg and butter merchant William Morrison opened a stall on Bradford market.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

In a concurrent transaction, Saint-Gobain announced plans to sell its glass packaging manufacturer Verallia.  Sika said it does not support the change in control.  The target’s board and management team have threatened to resign following the closing of this transaction as they do not believe they are fit to serve in the best interest of the group and its shareholders.  Sika’s controlling members said the new structure of the company would cause disruption to its current growth strategy.  According to Saint-Gobain, the deal is expected to generate EUR 100.00 million in synergies from 2017 and EUR 180.00 million from 2019.  The transaction will create value by the fourth year following completion.  Founded in 1910, Sika is billed as a leader in the development and production of systems and products for bonding, sealing, damping, reinforcing and protecting in the building and motor sectors.

Estrada Trading is the Central Java-based apparel manufacturer’s second largest backer with 2.56 billion shares currently representing an interest of 19.7 per cent, though this will be diluted to 13.8 per cent following the proposed listing.  This investor intends to sell its stake to long-term international investors within three months of Sri Rejeki Isman, better known as Sritex, debuting on the Indonesian Stock Exchange on 17th June.  Huddleston Indonesia is the company’s largest shareholder with an 80.2 per cent stake, which will be diluted to 56.1 per cent by the IPO, while founder Haji Muhammad Lukminto is the smallest equity owner with a little under 1.0 per cent.

Last year, the group bought IT contracting and recruitment firm Paracon in a take-private transaction worth just shy of ZAR 700.00 million (USD 80.67 million).  Richard Pike, chief executive of Adcorp, observed: “The two businesses are extremely complementary in that they deal in similar markets in the same niche skills set.   “As such, the opportunity for these two businesses to work together is significant.”  Pike also noted the cross-selling opportunities that will be created from the acquisition, as well as the ability to swap products and ideas, and concluded by saying integration will be almost seamless and Adcorp will offer employment to all existing Paxus staff.  Adcorp is settling the purchase price in cash, funded by a share placing with South African financial institutions and around ZAR 252.00 million of debt to be raised in Australian markets.   The deal is expected to close by the end of January.  Founded in 1973 and headquartered in Melbourne, Paxus is a well-recognised name in Australia’s IT recruitment market, with offices throughout the country.

Reuters noted YTO Express is the latest courier attempting to access public funds in order to maintain its competitiveness and follows in the footsteps of Shentong Express.  In December 2015 the rival announced a reverse takeover with quoted plumbing equipment and valve manufacturer Zhejiang IDC Fluid Control worth CNY 16.90 billion.  Essence Securities analyst Jiang Ming told Reuters that backdoor listings are becoming increasingly popular because of the waiting time for China’s initial public offering (IPO) arena.  He noted that Shentong Express’ decision to reverse into Zhejiang IDC has frightened other companies into tapping the capital markets as the courier industry enters into a phase of reorganising and upgrading.

The online newspaper said the business, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, could raise around USD 500.00 million based on a company valuation of between USD 2.50 billion and USD 3.00 billion.  At this size, the offering would be the largest by an Israeli firm this year.  Mobileye was founded in 1999 by businessman and a professor of computer science at the Hewbrew University of Jersusalem.  It claims to be a technological leader in advanced image sensing and processing for automotive applications, with a product offering that spans the entire spectrum of driving assistance and safety.  Mobileye’s EyeQ family of system-on-chips collects and analyses visual information from traffic lanes, sign recognition, vehicle and pedestrian detection and lighting functions.  Through the use of algorithms and in-car monocular cameras, drivers can be alerted to imminent collisions and road departures, while the technology can also intervene and activate the brakes ahead of time to avoid potential accidents.  Among the company’s partners are German automotive giant BMW, which is thought to have been the first to adopt the system, closely followed by US group GM Motors.  In 2000 Mobileye secured its first round of funding from Motorola Ventures and went on to raise several more.  Its most recent cash injection was last summer, when it received around USD 400.00 million from unspecified investors. At the time, the firm said the amount was based on a pre-money equity valuation of USD 1.50 billion.  About a month before that round, Calcalist reported German luxury car maker Porsche was in discussions to pick up a 10.0 per cent interest in Mobileye, while Blackstone and Fidelity were also set to invest between USD 100.00 million and USD 150.00 million each.

No further information regarding the capital increase was disclosed.  Its shares closed at AUD 0.49 (GBP 0.28) today (13th January; AUD 0.49; 12th January: AUD 0.49; 11th January: AUD 0.52).  Hillgrove is a resources company focused on developing its Indonesian, South Australian and Queensland base and precious metals projects to become a billion-dollar-plus mid-tier gold and copper player.  The group expects its growth to come from its flagship asset, Kanmantoo copper/gold mine in South Australia, and from greenfield exploration projects in Indonesia and North Queensland.  It is also seeking to buy new properties and purchase strategic investments in associated businesses, according to its website.  Kanmantoo is configured to initially be a 2.00 million tonnes per annum open cut mine scheduled to turn out around 17,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate and 8,000 ounces of gold per annum – with production targeted for the first quarter of 2011.

The group needs to raise funds and, as part of a restructuring, one if its subsidiaries will receive investment from a strategic partner.   “We are discussing advanced payments and capital investments with customers,” the group said.   “Elpida also continues to discuss with its major banks the refinancing of borrowings so that company business operations can be conducted normally,” it added.  The group makes chips for mobile phones, digital consumer electronics and high-end servers.

The firm has not generated earnings at pre-tax or net level since 2006.   The semiconductor industry has suffered supply and demand problems which began before the financial crisis but were exacerbated by the resulting squeeze on consumer and corporate spending.

Standard Life is one of the largest stockholders in Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and HBOS. Speaking on BBC Radio Four, Euan Stirling said it is looking “increasingly likely” that his company will hike its stake in the two lenders.  “I say that because of the scale and the extent of the support package that was put in place over the last two weeks,” he explained.  Sterling was referring to the government recapitalisation plan, under which RBS will sell preference shares to the treasury in exchange for a GBP 5 billion cash injection.  HBOS and its new owner Lloyds TSB will sell USD 4 billion worth of preference shares as part of the initiative.  Standard Life believes the two lenders will have attractive valuations after the capital increases.  Along with buying preferred stock, the government will underwrite a GBP 15 billion share issue for RBS and a GBP 13 billion offering from HBOS.    “We're still trying to assess what the future looks like as a co-investor with government but the valuation case is becoming pretty compelling; most of the domestic banks [are] trading at half of their book value,” Sterling said.

According to the sources, an auction process is underway and is expected to result in a deal valuing the business at over USD 3.00 billion.  A sale of the assets has been on the cards for a while; in April GSK announced it was looking into options for its established products portfolio.  Since then a number of parties have been linked with bids, such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Warburg Pincus, Blackstone, Advent International, Bain Capital and Mylan.  The auction proceeded to a second round in August, but Reuters said Apollo Global Management’s interest could throw a spanner into the works of competitors’ plans.  According to the sources, the investor is willing to buy all products being sold, as opposed to the regional activities targeted by other suitors.  They added that final bids are expected next week and GSK hopes to find a buyer by the end of the year.

       " 'A chance to buy into Turkey’s resilient banking sector – as General Electric (GE) exits Türkiye Garanti Bankasi – appears to have caught the of several major players.  Reuters picked up a report by business daily business daily Dunya, which said Spain’s Banco Santander is interested in the 20.9 per cent stake GE might sell.  In an announcement to the Turkish stock exchange regulator yesterday, the target said its US backer is considering its strategic options for the minority shareholding.  A fifth of Turkey’s largest bank by equity is worth around USD 3.20 billion in the markets. GE bought the stock from Dogus Holding for USD 1.80 billion in August 2005.  The Dunya report also suggested Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo and a Gulf-based fund are interested in Garanti shares possibly being divested by GE.  Citing analysts it did not name, Reuters questioned whether Santander would bid; targets of the eurozone’s largest lender are typically in need of restructuring.  Furthermore the Spanish group is focused on growth markets in Latin America, as well as Spain, the UK, Germany and Portugal, and has also made it known that it is not looking to expand into new territories at present.  However, one fund manager told the publication it might be buying Garanti stocks so it can sell them in the future.  The Istanbul-based lender’s share price has more than doubled in the last 12 months.  As at 31st December it had total assets of TRY 70.33 billion (USD 45.29 billion) – twice the TRY 35.14 billion held at the end of financial 2008.

Max’s started out in 1945 just after the end of the Second World War, when Maximo Gimenez befriended the US occupation troops stationed at Quezon City; this led to soldiers regularly visiting his home for drinks, and subsequently insisted on paying for the refreshments.  The café Gimenez opened initially served chicken, steaks and beverages, and when his niece created a special recipe for fried chicken the business really took off. Today, the chain offers diners seafood, bread and even chocolate cakes.  Max’s can now be found in California and other US states, as well as in the Metro Manila, southern and northern Luzon and Cebu, and it operates a franchise model as well as its own restaurants.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Sources close to the matter told the news provider the mainland-based developer of diagnostics, big data and drugs focused on the oncology field is gearing up for an initial public offering as early as the fourth quarter of the calendar year.  They added the usual cautions that preparations for the group, which claims to be the leading precision medicine company in China, are still in the early stages and, as such, details may change.  Founded in 2010, 3D has three platforms, one of which, next-generation sequencing (NGS), is based on bioinformatics analyses piecing together small fragments of DNA by mapping the individual reads to the human reference genome.  The group’s oncology data service integrates genome profiles, clinical records and pharmacology data to let the company predict patient response rate and improve the design of clinical trials to get a better success rate in development.  3D’s patient derived cancer cell lines library is the world’s largest and is based on oncology samples from the liver, lung, oesophagus, colon, rectum, gallbladder, head and neck.   Using this latter content collection, the company can conduct drug screening in hundreds of human tumour cell lines with clear genome information, mimicking \"clinical trials\" in the cancer patient population even in the early preclinical stage.  According to the website, 3D has offices and facilities across the country, including headquarters and a research and development centre in Shanghai, global clinical operations in Beijing and clinical diagnostic laboratories in Shanghai and Shenyang.

       " 'Shares in Serabi Mining have soared on the news that the miner has received preliminary approaches that may or may not lead to an offer or a deal over its assets.  Stock which previously traded at 0.6 pence on 31st October on the Aim market of the London Stock Exchange jumped 275 per cent to close at 2.25 pence on 3rd November following news of the preliminary discussions to give the group a market cap of GBP 3.15 million.  Since opening this morning the price has fallen by 11.1 per cent to 2.00 pence at 7.44 am GMT.  The gold explorer is involved in the evaluation, development and mining of gold deposits in Brazil. Its primary operation is the wholly-owned Palito gold mine, which contains gold-copper veins, located in the Tapajos region of northern Brazil.  Fiscal 2008 has not been a kind year to London-based Serabi; it has seen its share price, which was 31.5 pence on 8th January fall, throughout the year.  It has come up against mining problems in the Palito district as production fell significantly short of targets in August and as such “a detailed review of operations at the Palito mine has been undertaken”.  Serabi has been looking at options which will allow it to continue a reduced level of production for a longer period as originally estimated and for once market conditions are helping.  The group cited factors such as the strength of gold prices, which have not experienced the price fall of many other commodities.  “The London Bullion Market Association average spot price for gold during the period from January to June was USD 912. Actual prices realised were USD 918 per ounce for concentrate sales and USD 895 for gold bullion which is sold in the domestic Brazilian market.”  The depreciation of the Brazilian real, which has fallen by 30 per cent over the last two months, also had a positive effect on operating margins – balancing out what could have been worse results.  For the six months ended 30th June 2008 Serabi had unaudited revenue of USD 9.89 million, compared to USD 13.02 million in H1 2007 and USD 25.10 million for the full year ended 31st December 2007.  Profit was USD 388,107 in H1 2008, a decrease of 85.9 per cent year-on-year (H1 2007: USD 2.76 million; FY 2007: USD 5.39 million).  Net loss widened from USD 497,522 in H1 2007 to USD 1.61 million in H1 2008, already outstripping the full-year loss of USD 122,879 in 2007.  Not even the higher gold prices in 2008 could offset “reduced levels of production during the first half of the year had a detrimental effect on the revenues of the company and have also impacted on the unit cash costs”.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The newspaper suggested a transaction could value Cofunds, which is used by financial advisers to make investment decisions on behalf of clients, at GBP 200.00 million.  It said the other interested party is private equity group Bridgepoint Capital, which just has one financial services firm, 1st Capital, in its current portfolio.  In its unsourced report, the Telegraph claimed L&G’s executive director of savings wrote to Cofunds’ chairman Charlie Eppinger to express interest, and an offer went to the target’s board in October.   The insurer is working with Douglas Black, who founded financial advisor Towry Law, the paper added, noting L&G is yet to receive a formal response from its target.  Meanwhile, Bridgepoint has also asked to speak to Cofunds’ board, the Telegraph said.  Cofunds is 25.0 per cent owned by L&G. Its other shareholders include pensions specialist Prudential, fund managers Threadneedle and Jupiter International Group, as well as technology group International Financial Data Services.  It was established in 2000 as a joint venture between Gartmore Investment Management, Prudential’s M&G, Jupiter and Threadneedle. The four partners invested GBP 20.00 million and the business launched a year later.  London-based Cofunds now claims to be the UK’s leading independent investment platform. It was worth USD 95.98 million in 2010 revenue after two consecutive years of growth (FY 2009: USD 73.28 million; FY 2008: USD 57.72 million).

       " 'It has been just over two years since China National Chemical (ChemChina) paid USD 43.00 billion for Swiss chemical company Syngenta and already 0s of a potential initial public offering (IPO) have surfaced.  Bloomberg cited people familiar with the matter as saying the pesticides producer could be listed in the industry’s largest-ever flotation next year.   According to the sources, ChemChina’s top executives are preparing for an IPO as soon as mid-2020, with Syngenta in talks with potential investment banks to work on the deal.  Financial terms were not disclosed by the insiders with knowledge of the situation; however, most European stock exchanges require a company to list between 20.0 and 25.0 per cent of the total shares.   Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, shows the largest IPO in the chemical manufacturing sector on record to date involves Germany’s Covestro raising EUR 4.86 billion in Frankfurt in 2015.   Based on Syngenta’s valuation when it was taken over by ChemChina, 25.0 per cent of the company would be worth USD 10.75 billion, therefore potentially making it the industry’s biggest-ever stock market listing.   Sources, who asked not to be identified, told Bloomberg the group is likely to seek a debut in Europe, rather than pursuing overseas flotations in Hong Kong or New York.   A record IPO would be the second time Syngenta featured in a top deal, given its takeover by ChemChina was also the largest overseas acquisition by a Chinese company on record, according to Zephyr.  There can be no guarantee of a listing taking place, the insiders noted, adding no final decision has been made.  However, the timing of the IPO could also be affected by the fact the Chinese government has still not approved a potential USD 100.00 billion merger between ChemChina and Sinochem Group, which have been discussing a combination since 2016.  Syngenta claims to be one of the world’s largest agricultural companies, with 28,000 employees across 90 countries.   In the opening six months of 2019, the group generated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of USD 1.46 billion on sales of USD 6.77 billion, compared to USD 1.71 billion and USD 7.25 billion, respectively, in the corresponding period of 2018.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Thursday that struggling investment bank Bear Stearns is aiming to alleviate its domestic concerns following the subprime crisis by jumping on the back of China's fast-growing funds market and taking a 10 per cent stake in China Asset Management.  China Asset Management (CAM) is wholly-owned by China's leading brokerage CITIC Securities and sources suggest that CAM will merge with CITIC Fund Management - another CITIC Securities subsidiary - before opening itself up to foreign investors.  Bear Stearns, the fifth-largest investment bank in the US, appears to be the leading candidate to secure the investment especially as in October it agreed with CITIC Securities to form a broad strategic alliance that would see the two parties exchange equity stakes in each other.  At the time of the disclosure there was no mention of Bear Stearns investing in CAM.  The Reuters article claims that although T. Rowe approached CAM earlier than Bear Stearns, the aforementioned partnership should see it secure the alliance. However, China Knowledge has claimed today that Zhang Shaoqi, vice general manager of CAM, has denied the recent speculation regarding Bear Stearns.  CAM is in its tenth year of operations and the assets managed by the firm exceed CNY 250 billion, making it the largest fund manager in China.  Information published at the beginning of the year by the official Shanghai Securities News claims that the Chinese fund management sector enjoyed its best ever year last year, with combined assets under management climbing 264 per cent from CNY 879 billion to CNY 3.2 trillion.

Chairman Mehmet Ali Aydinlar has decided to retain his 10.0 per cent participation and will remain in his current position.  Acibadem Sigorta is billed as a leading provider of health insurance services for corporate and individual clients in Turkey with the second-largest market share in the industry.  The company is headquartered in Istanbul and maintains six regional offices across the country.   Abraaj claims it has helped Acibadem Saglik to become one of the fastest expanding and most profitable health insurance providers in Turkey, achieving over 30.0 per cent annual premium growth over the past two years and one of the highest returns on equity in the market.

The news came as the Arklow-based toilet and bathroom sink maker published disappointing full-year 2007 results on the back of \"an uncertain property market\".  Its stocks were up at 85 pence this afternoon from a 70.25 pence close on Wednesday despite a public announcement that the preliminary approach \"may or may not lead to a formal offer being made\".  \"Discussions are at a very early stage and there is no certainty that they will lead to an offer,\" Qualceram added.   The announcement certainly diverted attention from the 13.3 per cent drop in revenue reported today, and boosted the group\\'s market cap to GBP 18.845 million from GBP 15.574 million at yesterday\\'s close.  In fiscal 2007, revenue fell to EUR 90 million from EUR 102 million the previous year, while profit before exceptional items was down 73.1 per cent to EUR 1.1 million from EUR 4.1 million, reducing gross margin to 30.5 per cent from 32.3 per cent.  Specialising in both the manufacture and sale of bathroom suites, Qualceram leads its market in the UK and Ireland.  It operates through four bathroom product subsidiaries: Shires in Dublin, Belfast and West Yorkshire; the Lancashire-based handcrafted sinks and terracotta specialist Shaws of Darwen; West Yorkshire\\'s Trent Bathrooms; and Lancashire shower maker Selecta.  With reduced demand for its products as the housing markets continue to slow in the UK and Ireland, the firm has seen its shares lose 50.2 per cent of their value year-on-year.   The unnamed \"third party\" will no doubt be looking to capitalise on Qualceram\\'s low share price after the group hit a 52-week low of 65.22 pence on March 7th.  However, chief executive John O\\'Loughlin was upbeat today about the company\\'s future and gave no indication that a buy-out was on his mind.   He drew attention to the recent disposal of an Arklow property, which brought in EUR 30.025 million and \"represented very good value\" for shareholders.   \"The disposal has further strengthened the balance sheet, and combined with management\\'s continuing efforts to improve the cost base…we are confident that the group will weather the current downturn and emerge as a stronger group, positioned for growth,\" O\\'Loughlin said.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Its planned CAD 3.17 billion (USD 3.35 billion) takeover of Canadian peer TMX Group fell apart last month due to lack of shareholder support.  Singapore’s stock exchange operator might now be interested in bidding for LSE and China could be willing to block the move by pushing HKEx forward as a suitor, the Independent said.  Alex Au, managing director of Richland Capital Management, told Bloomberg there is little chance of a takeover of LSE by its Hong Kong counterpart. Au cited political issues and suggested Britain would not allow its main exchange to be controlled by Hong Kong.  However, the news provider cited LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet as saying his firm will look “both west and east” for growth.  At the London bourse’s annual general meeting this week, chairman Chris Gibson-Smith said: “Much of the economic growth of the coming decades will be in the high growth, high potential new economies in Asia and elsewhere and partnerships such as the one we signed with Mongolia in April offer a perspective on London's future sources of strength.”   LSE did not manage to convince a two-thirds majority of TMX shareholders to back a merger and has been a takeover target since this deal collapsed.  Its share price has increased by almost two thirds since a year ago.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",
       " 'New Zealand temporary staffing provider AWF is signing on the dotted line for Madison Recruitment and Madison Force, spending NZD 36.00 million (USD 29.69 million) to use the group as a springboard into the white collar recruitment and contracting sector.  The targets in question are billed as well respected market leaders with offices in Auckland’s central business district, East Tamaki, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch.   Madison generated combined revenue of more than NZD 56.00 million in the 12 months ended 31st March 2013 and the group is currently experiencing strong turnover and earnings growth going into FY 2013-14.  AWF chief executive Mike Huddleston and director Simon Hull are billing the deal as a strategic move, giving the largely blue collar-focused player increased exposure to – by establishing a major presence within – the white collar sector while being aligned with an existing successful brand.  Financially, the deal comprises an initial NZD 30.00 million and an additional payment of up to NZD 6.00 million on meeting certain earnings targets for the 52 weeks following the effective date deadline of 4th November 2013.  AWF has been hunting for an acquisition in recent months. The company has a strong, established market position within the largely blue collar sectors but needs a broader involvement in order to sustain growth due to flat performance expected for the first six months of this fiscal year.  The proposed deal, slated to complete in December, is expected to lift the staffing provider’s earnings per share by over 50.0 per cent for FY 2014-15, paving the way for a steady progression in dividends.  AWF claims to be New Zealand’s largest provider of temporary staff to industry, placing on average over 3,000 people each working day of the year into temporary employment.  The company operates two distinct business units, Tradeforce Recruitment and Allied Work Force, the latter of which does business through three separate divisions, namely AWF Labour, AWF Manufacturing and Logistics and AWF Trades.  AWF services employers across a broad range of industry sectors including: manufacturing and food processing; warehousing and transport; construction, civil and infrastructure maintenance; and waste management.  It generated net profit after tax of NZD 6.90 million on revenue of NZD 130.50 million in FY 2012-13, compared to NZD 2.60 million on turnover of NZD 104.90 million in FY 2011-12.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The Chinese rival of US camera maker and related mobile app and video-editing software developer GoPro has just tapped Everest Venture Capital, MG Holdings and Huajin capital for fresh equity to bankroll technology innovation.  It wants to accelerate the development of cameras and related equipment to continue growing its line of professional 360-degree cameras for virtual reality filmmakers.  Furthermore, proceeds will fund the roll-out of more domestic marketing activities and increase research and after-sales service operations in key global markets.  However, the company, officially known as Shenzhen Arashi Vision, also has a first-time share sale up its sleeves: founder and chief executive (CEO) Jingkang (JK) Liu has told various media outlets he intends to list the firm next year.  In an interview with CNBC, JK Liu said: “We plan on an IPO in 2020 and take on new investments from the public market so we can more aggressively innovate and change the camera industry.”  While the CEO noted a listing on the mainland could be an option, though it is not yet decided upon, he separately told Bloomberg over the phone that the existing Growth Enterprise Board in Shenzhen may be a potential venue.  Another destination under consideration could include the soon-to-be-launched Nasdaq-style technology board, which is expected to raise Shanghai’s capital market profile.  When speaking to TechCrunch, JK Liu declined to provide details of the planned flotation but said the success of the Insta360’s action camera line has led to five-times revenue growth in two years.  Furthermore, the camera company has been profitable since 2017, which is in direct contrast to rival GoPro.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The Tennessee-headquartered software-as-a-service company in question was founded in 1996 as InterMed and develops proprietary technology to support over 2,500 hospitals in the US and more than 9,000 other healthcare providers across all 50 states.  Its platforms help these organisations with administrative tasks, including verifying a patient's identity and ability to pay, estimating a bill and establishing eligibility for financial and charitable aid.  Passport Health is touted as having attractive financial characteristics as turnover is generated largely through subscriptions, renewal rates of about 95.0 per cent and average contract duration of three to five years.  The group is expected to book revenue of USD 121.00 million – representing an organic growth of 23.0 per cent – and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of USD 30.00 million in the 12 months ending 31st December 2013.  In FY 2014, its top line could reach roughly USD 145.00 million, of which 84.0 per cent is already booked and contracted, with EBIT margins in the high 20s.  Experian is picking up Passport Health from private equity investors, management and employees and the business will form part of Experian Credit Services activities in North America.  The information services company entered the healthcare payments market in 2008 with the acquisition of SearchAmerica for USD 90.00 million, before consolidating and extending its footprint in 2011 by taking over Medical Present Value for USD 185.00 million.  It subsequently merged these two businesses to create Experian Healthcare, a subsidiary which is expected to generate revenue of USD 75.00 million in the financial year ending 31st March 2014, with organic turnover growth in the mid-teens.  By adding Passport Health to its portfolio, Experian should boost the number of hospitals served from about 500 to 3,000, representing 45.0 per cent of those based in the US.  Its healthcare provider clientele should top 9,000, compared with the current level of 350.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

As a consequence, the body has extended its review period of the deal; it was originally scheduled to rule on the matter on 27th March, but this has now been extended to 10th April.  However, the EC stopped short of specifying which concessions had been offered by Denmark-headquartered Maersk Line.  The firm agreed to pick up German peer Hamburg Sud for EUR 4.70 billion back in December.  Last month it was reported that in addition to the go ahead from the EC, approvals would be required from other unspecified regulators.  News of a purchase of Hamburg Sud first emerged in November 2016, when the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, said Dr August Oetker had put the business on the block.  Commenting on the planned deal, the target’s executive chairman Dr Ottmar Gast said it would benefit the firm by enabling it to access the buyer’s superior network and systems and giving both businesses strengthened product portfolios.  The two parties will retain their separate brands upon closing.  Hamburg Sud was founded in 1871 and now claims to be one of the world’s ten largest container shipping lines, as well as one of the leading providers in the North-South trades.  According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, there were 30 takeovers within the deep sea freight transportation sector announced last year, the largest of which involved Hapag-Lloyd picking up Kuwait-headquartered United Arab Shipping Company for USD 7.49 billion.

Brandon Hill Capital, Panmure Gordon and Tavistock Communications are advising on the deal.  Chief executive of the business, Greg Coleman noted that the company is expected to use the proceeds for general working capital purposes, as well as to continue to seek both debt and equity financing to meet future investment requirements.    Independent Resources, which is listed on London’s AIM exchange under the ticker symbol IRG, was founded in 2005 and focuses on acquiring and developing exploration opportunities.  The business has a major oil prospect in Tunisia, plus a gas storage facility in north-eastern Italy and hopes to build a portfolio of production assets in countries around the Mediterranean basin.

The London-headquartered company is deemed to be an investing group after disposing of the majority of its operations last year, and as such it needs a significant war chest in order to implement its business policy.  With this in mind it is actively considering implementing ways of raising additional funds, either in the form of equity or debt, in order to focus on growth and expansion opportunities within the European Union and the US.  CSS Stellar noted it wants to leverage its board’s knowledge, experience and contacts by targeting the leisure, corporate services, consultancy and brand licensing sectors, though it is also open to looking outside these industries.  Last year the group made the decision to cease all of its trading activities in its core areas of motor sports and golf – these operations were based on contracts due to end during the year to 31st December 2010 and at the time there was no certainty that these agreements would be renewed.  So, in September it sold off the business and assets of its golf management division Hambric Stellar Golf via a trade and assets disposal.   CSS Stellar followed this up with the divestment of its motor sport client business in December, entering into an agreement with GP Sports Holding, a company wholly owned by chairman Julian Jakobi, whereby it ceased to undertake these activities in exchange for taking a 20.0 per cent carried economic interest in this acquisition vehicle.

       " 'Luxshare Precision Industry is working on listing its camera module manufacturing unit in Hong Kong within the next one to two years as part of plans to shake up the supply chain market, the Nikkei Asian Review reported.  An executive with knowledge of the matter told the English-language business journal the Chinese consumer electronics parts maker wants to take a largest share of the smartphone industry from the likes of Sunny Optical and O-film Tech.  The camera module arm, which was acquired from Lite-On Technology earlier this year, is already the main supplier to Huawei Technologies, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo, the Nikkei Asian Review noted.  While it turns over TWD 38.00 billion to TWD 40.00 billion (USD 1.20 billion to USD 1.30 billion) in annual revenue, intense industrial competition has led to red ink at its bottom line since the second half of 2017.  Lite-On announced in February the transfer of the mobile phone camera module unit to Luxshare’s LuxVisions Innovation for USD 360.00 million and rights to obtain 10.0 per cent of this newly established subsidiary.  The deal comprised the operations and assets ranging from inventories, equipment, technology and personnel to intellectual property and client and supplier relationship.  Products of this camera module business are mainly applied mobile phones, tablet and notebook personal computers for customers throughout Europe, North America and Asia.  James Wei, an analyst at Yuanta Investment Consulting, told the Nikkei Asian Review: \"With the advanced technologies purchased from Lite-On, we foresee Sunny Optical and O-film will start feeling the heat from Luxshare from now.”  International Data Corporation (IDC) announced at the end of July that the overall smartphone market declined 1.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2018 when compared to 348.20 million units shipped in Q2 2017.  While Apple reported its highest-ever third quarter revenue, the iPhone manufacturer was actually overtaken by Huawei in terms of worldwide sales.  IDC noted: “At the same time, Xiaomi, OPPO, and vivo are all slowly pushing their customer base upstream at a price tier slightly lower than the top three.   “This is an area they should all watch closely as the builds in this segment are getting increasingly more advanced.”  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Bilfinger Berger Australia (BBA), one of the largest players in its domestic market, worked on the Sydney Opera House and Melbourne’s Etihad Stadium and is currently building the North-South Bypass Tunnel and the Gateway Bridge in Brisbane.  The Financial Times speculated that its flotation could raise between AUD 1.00 billion (EUR 619.58 million) and AUD 1.50 billion but neither the German nor its New South Wales-based unit gave any financial details.  “It is unlikely any final decisions will be made for a number of months,” BBA said, noting that it will make “considerable input” into the sale.  BBA’s chief executive Peter Brecht said: “A potential IPO of the Australian business would facilitate better access to capital markets for the Australian business, while at the same time freeing capital for Bilfinger Berger to pursue growth opportunities in the services segment.”  The business has projected turnover of AUD 4.70 billion in the current financial year – a 36.3 per cent increase from AUD 3.45 billion in 2008 (FY 2007: AUD 2.97 billion; FY 2006: AUD 3.21 billion; FY 2005: AUD 2.98 billion).  It has built strong brands in Australian building and civil engineering, including Bauldies and Abis.  However, the German firm is looking to shift its focus from cyclical construction to its higher margin property services; third-quarter earnings reported today were down 87.0 per cent.  “The company has posted positive Q3 performance figures and the IPO would be a pretty interesting move that could raise up to EUR 1.00 billion,\" WestLB analyst Ralf Dorper told Reuters.

Crop protection chemical producer Cheminova has decided to formally integrate the affiliate, which has been part of the business since early 2008, by taking over the 25.0 per cent stake currently held by three family members for DKK 65.00 million (USD 12.62 million).  In January 2008 the suitor entered into an agreement to acquire a 50.0 per cent ownership participation in the German Stähler group of companies for EUR 30.00 million in a bid to substantially improve its position in Europe.   At the time, the Stade-headquartered firm had direct access to markets in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, generating sales of EUR 75.00 million.  However, as fiscal 2008 results did not live up to expectations – in part due to the financial crisis – the Stähler family decided to invite Cheminova to become majority owner in a bid to shore up Stähler’s financial position and support future development.  The shareholder picked up a further 25.0 per cent stake for EUR 9.10 million and obtained an option to acquire the remaining interest in five years at a price based on the target’s performance.  Auriga Industries said yesterday this latest purchase is to be made in cash and shares from treasury holdings, and is expected to complete in early July.  Cheminova's main business area is making and marketing of crop protection products – developing chemicals and supplying insecticides, herbicides and fungicides.  Auriga said the market for crop protection products is expected to grow in 2011, despite climatic challenges in some markets.

Ardent intends to issue 14.96 million of its own stocks – equivalent to a 50.0 per cent stake in its enlarged capital – for every RSPM unit.  For this USD 23.00 million consideration it wants all the target’s mineral rights and a property known as Fazenda Lavras, located just 8.00 miles from Paracatu, where Kinross Gold has Brazil’s largest gold mine.  “Preliminary evaluations conducted by independent geologists indicate reserves of approximately 5.70 million ounces of gold in the property, consisting of approximately 400 acres,” Ardent said.    “In addition, RSPM controls the mineral rights on more than 1,000 acres of adjacent properties,” it added.  There is a lengthy list of conditions that need to be met before the transaction will go ahead, including a thorough geology survey, the completion of audited financial statements and due diligence.  In fact, RSPM has not yet received all the necessary government approvals to start mining, and is in the process of applying for environmental permits and gold production licences.   Ardent will not go ahead with the transaction without these rubber stamps, and it will not have financing in place until due diligence is completes and the deal closes.

Chief executive Andrew Mackenzie believes improving operating and capital efficiency, as well as the firm’s competitiveness, will increase cash returns to investors.  Bloomberg picked up on the news and cited David Radclyffe, an analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, as saying the Fayetteville assets are the least valuable part of the London and Melbourne company’s portfolio.  This is not the first time this year that BHP Billiton has been linked with an asset sale; in April the group said it could spin-off non-core activities such as its aluminium and nickel units into a separate company.  At the time it said an outright sale or a listing on the London, Australian and South African stock exchanges were among options being considered.  However, the company has also been linked with a purchase; in April the Globe and Mail said it could decide to bid for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, although the news provider did add that no deal had been reached.

       " 'UK-based perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) as high-street retailers continue to struggle amid the increasing shift to online shopping, Sky News reported.   The broadcaster, which did not cite its sources, noted a listing could fetch around GBP 200.00 million, although, if the company decides to go ahead with the flotation, it would likely take place in 2019.   Owned by Manchester-based entrepreneur Sanjay Vadera, the Fragrance Shop is billed as the UK’s largest independent perfumer and has already reportedly mandated Rothschild to work on plans.  Sky News said city advisors are expected to pitch for the IPO in the coming weeks, with the company’s controlling shareholder yet to make a formal decision on any form of corporate action.  The move comes during one of the most brutal times for UK high-street retailers, the broadcaster added, with multiple brands filing for bankruptcy, including Maplin and Toys R Us.   In addition, Carpetright, House of Fraser and Mothercare are under pressure, according to Sky News.  Sky News observed a spokesperson for the Fragrance Shop said following strong year-on-year growth and positive trading figures over Christmas “the business is exploring a number of strategic expansion opportunities”.  He added that a review would help the company expand its market success and continue to produce strong results within a challenging industry.   The Fragrance Shop posted a 5.6 per cent increase in sales in the six weeks to 31st December 2017, the broadcaster noted, adding this bucks the trend of most retailers in the country.   Founded in 1994, the business had over 130 fragrance brands, including Chanel, Tom Ford, Gucci and Mugler, among others, and sells from over 200 stores, an online e-commerce platform and telephone sales.   Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, shows that just one other health and personal care store operator worldwide has announced an IPO in 2018 to date.   This deal involved Cayman Islands-incorporated beauty and health products retail stores group Mi Ming Mart, which raised HKD 75.60 million (GBP 6.96 million) through a listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Oil and gas exploration business Paltar Petroleum is to make its stock market debut on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), it was announced today.  Neither the size of the initial public offering (IPO) nor details of the stocks to be listed have been disclosed.  The news came as Sydney-based Sinovus Mining entered a share subscription agreement with the company, which means it will hold at least a 10.0 per cent stake in the firm post-flotation.  Sinovus will first buy 6.67 million Paltar ordinary securities for AUD 1.00 million (USD 1.07 million).  Within seven days of the IPO, it will then issue 23.69 million of its own shares and 23.69 million free attaching options to Wotan Group in exchange for an additional 5.29 million units in Paltar.  Sinovus may rescind the agreement if listing does not take place by 31st December.  Paltar is in a 50.0 per cent farm-in agreement with Sweetpea Petroleum regarding three exploration permits in the Beetaloo Basin in the Northern Territory. These rights are under application at present, with approval for two expected around March 2012. The third should follow in 2013 at the earliest.  All three licences are pending the go ahead from both the Northern Land Council, which represents the rights of Aboriginal peoples in the region, and native title owners themselves.  Exploration in Beetaloo began in 1984 and has, to date, confirmed that the 3,000 metre sediment column in the basin contains substantial hydrocarbon resources which are likened to unconventional projects in North America.  The three permits that Paltar has rights over cover sites along the western and eastern margins. The two in the former area cover a geology which, according to Sinovus, is similar to Shenandoah 1, where 1,000 metres of the Kyalla shale bears oil shows. The main focus is oil.  Exploration on the eastern margin site is targeted at both oil and gas.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'German solar power company Conergy is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) as it returns to profit just two years after it filed for insolvency, the group’s owners told the Financial Times (FT).  According to the newspaper, the Hamburg-headquartered firm is aiming for a valuation of between USD 2.00 billion and USD 3.00 billion, including debt.  The IPO would provide an exit for majority-owned private equity group Kawa Capital Management, the FT noted.  Chief executive Andrew de Pass told the paper that Conergy posted sales of around USD 500.00 million in 2014 and operating profit of less than USD 10.00 million.  He added the company “is really well-positioned to go public in the next 12 to 24 months. The market wants an alternative to SunEdison and we’re that alternative.”   Conergy was one of Europe’s largest solar power groups before it went bankrupt in 2013, the FT reported, the firm would be 20.0 to 30.0 per cent of the size of the world’s largest wind energy group, which is worth around USD 11.00 billion.  In 2012, prior to filing for insolvency, the once Frankfurt-listed company generated a net loss of EUR 99.00 million on sales of EUR 473.50 million.  Conergy, which was not alone in the wave of German bankruptcies following competition from Chinese conglomerates, was partly acquired by Kawa after it bought the sales offices of the firm for an undisclosed amount in 2013.  De Pass also spoke in a telephone interview with Bloomberg, suggesting the soon-to-be listed company expects to install about 450.00 megawatts of projects this year as part of a pipeline that may grow to 4.00 gigawatts.  He observed that Conergy is looking at expansion plans in the US, where it believes residential and commercial demand is the fastest growing segment.  De Pass told the FT that group will also move into markets in Latin America, Turkey and Africa.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " \"The chairman of German chipmaker Infineon Technologies has been in negotiations with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts' (KKR's) European boss over the possibility of merging with KKR's Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors, it has emerged.  The Financial Times Deutschland (FTD) made the claims today, and said discussions between Infineon's Max Dietrich Kley and Johannes Huthat of KKR go against the wishes of Infineon's chief executive Wolfgang Ziebart, who opposes a tie-up with NXP.  Founded by Philips more than 50 years ago, Eindhoven-based NXP makes semiconductors, system solutions and software for electronic devices including mobile phones, personal media players and televisions. It generated EUR 4.727 billion in revenue last year.  KKR took on the firm in 2006, since which time it has not made a profit for the private equity buyer, recording a EUR 461 million net loss in 2007.  Neubiberg-based Infineon, which last month was 0ed as a private equity takeover target, primarily makes chips for the automotive industry. It leads the European auto semiconductor supply market and holds second place in the world.  The group also supplies the industrial and communications markets, with its chips found in mobile phones and wireless and wireline communications products.  The group has been struggling with loss-making memory chip subsidiary Qimonda and has not generated net profit since 2004.  The FTD said Ziebart favours a Qimonda sale, while Kley would prefer to move more cautiously on the issue.  Infineon was worth EUR 7.695 billion in sales last year, meaning a combined NXP-Infineon business would have revenues of around EUR 12.422 billion based on last year's figures.  The group has recorded net profit only once in the last seven fiscal periods, and last year its saw bottom-line losses widen from EUR 268 million to EUR 368 million. However, it typically carries no net leverage and had EUR 582 million surplus cash in the same year.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",
       " \"The Queensland government is selling half of its holding in Brisbane-based rail transport services provider Aurizon Holdings, formerly known as QR National, in a deal worth AUD 806.00 million (USD 838.76 million).  Through the transaction, 200.00 million shares in Australia’s largest coal transporter by rail will be offered to domestic and offshore institutional and sophisticated investors. The offer price of AUD 4.03 apiece represents a moderate discount to its last trading price of AUD 4.04.   The government will also receive a dividend of AUD 0.04 per share from Aurizon later this month upon completion of the divestment.  Treasurer Tim Nicholls noted in a statement: “We have again fulfilled our commitment to achieve the best possible price for the sale of a significant proportion of our remaining shares in Aurizon.”  He added that the disposal represents a AUD 300.00 million gain for the state after the freight rail operator's debut on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in 2010 which was priced at AUD 2.54 apiece. The proceeds are expected to be used to pay down debt.  Following the stake sale, the government’s holding in the group will drop from 18.2 per cent to 8.9 per cent, which keeps the state as a substantial shareholder in the listed company.   Prior to the move, Queensland already privatised part of its ownership interest in Aurizon between last October and November, from 34.0 per cent to 18.2 per cent.  However, the stakeholder stressed it does not intend to carry out a further selldown in the near term while it continues to review its remaining stake in the freight operator.  With solid foundations built from more than 100 years of rail freight experience, Aurizon provides road-based freight transport and infrastructure services to the industry, moving thousands of tonnes of coal and other minerals across Australia every day.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Spain’s Valencia Club de Fútbol (Valencia CF) is planning a capital increase exercise to raise around EUR 92.40 million, according to Expansión.  The Spanish business daily gave no further details, but did say the 90-year-old club has agreed the transaction.  Following a disastrous 2007-08 season, when Valencia CF faced relegation from Spain’s premier division, La Liga, the then manager Ronald Koeman was sacked.  As recently as 2003-04, Valencia CF, also known as los Che, was counted with Real Madrid and Barcelona as the country’s Big Three football clubs.  Financial difficulties have come alongside poor performance on the pitch, with the erection of a new stadium in north-west Valencia coming as a painful accompaniment to the global economic crisis.  “Many football clubs were hurt by the economic downturn, but the global financial crisis was an especially severe blow for Valencia,” observes the industry publication goal.com.  Construction of the new site, Nou Mestalla, was halted earlier this year as Valencia CF’s debt spiralled to around EUR 739.00 million, goal.com said.  In the year to 30th June 2007 – before the financial crisis took a foothold – the club’s revenue plunged 53.9 per cent from EUR 236.81 million to EUR 109.25 million (FY 2005: EUR 87.49 million).  There was a brief flash of black ink in 2006, when los Che posted net profit of EUR 13.53 million from EUR 23.84 million net loss in 2005, but the fiscal 2007 net loss was even wider at EUR 30.94 million.  Financial pressure was eased earlier this year with a EUR 50.00 million loan from local business group Fomento Urbano de Castellon, goal.com said. However, this money was put towards paying players rather than reducing the club’s debt pile.  “Valencia’s woes are far from behind them and this summer may see los Che forced to sell off some of their biggest stars in order to raise capital,” the publication claimed.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'A sale of Telenor’s 33.0 per cent stake in Vimpelcom is still on the cards, although the vendor has admitted the matter remains in the planning stages, the firm’s chief executive told Reuters.  Speaking to the news provider, Sigve Brekka said JPMorgan have been appointed to advise on the matter but the structure of the intended deal has yet to be established.  Analysts told Reuters Telenor does not have a lot of options available to it, which is complicating the process of completing a sale somewhat.  Haarvard Nilsson of Carnegie said the only obvious buyer at present is LetterOne, due to the vendor’s ownership structure, which means it is not well-placed to bargain for a higher consideration once negotiations get underway.  However, he posited that an alternative could be a sale of the Amsterdam-headquartered target’s Russian activities to a telecommunications player in the country and offloading the European activities to buyers based throughout the region.  Nasdaq-listed Vimpelcom has a history dating back 20 years and offers voice, fixed broadband, data and digital services to a customer base numbering in excess of 200.00 million and spanning 14 countries.  The company operates under a number of brand names, including Beeline, Kyivstar, WIND and Mobilink.  It posted revenue of USD 2.16 billion in the second quarter of 2016, down on the USD 2.57 billion recorded over the corresponding timeframe the previous year.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation for the year totalled USD 795.00 million, compared to the USD 1.07 billion generated in Q2 2015.  According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, there have been 254 deals targeting wired telecommunications carriers announced worldwide since the beginning of 2016.  Among those picked up was Canada-headquartered Manitoba Telecom Services, which BCE agreed to take over for USD 3.11 billion in May.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

At PLN 4.90 apiece, the tender is set at a 16.0 per cent premium to the three-month weighted average price and has already curried favour with shareholders.  PRA is financing the acquisition with cash held in Europe and borrowings under its European credit facility and has already received irrevocable undertakings for 65.0 per cent of DTP’s stock.  The company intends to use the domestic player as a springboard for growth in what it terms a “very active market for consumer NPLs [non-performing loans]”.  DTP is mainly focused on the purchase of receivables from banks, though it also outsources debt collection to specialised entities and mediates in the process of purchasing obligations, among other things.  The Warsaw-based organisation serves as a supervisor and controller of the DTP Capital Group companies, which includes Debt Trading Partners and Finanse Rataine.  PRA claims to be a leader in the acquisition and collection of NPLs in the Americas and Europe, with a focus on both unpaid and normal-course accounts receivable originally owned to credit grantors and government entities, among others.  However, the Virginia-based company also provides fee-based services ranging from contingent collections of NPLs in Europe to vehicle location, skip tracing and collateral recovery for auto lenders and law enforcement.

       " 'High street fashion retailer New Look has received an offer for its struggling French business Mim and is optimistic a deal can be reached.  The value clothing chain disclosed the news in its first quarter results statement, which showed sales and earnings surpassed expectations, boosted by demand for summer items like kimono jackets and printed trousers.  New Look chief executive Anders Kristiansen said the group’s accuracy in identifying key trends and success in its core UK and online business contributed to the strong performance.  While he did not go as far as naming the suitor for Mim, Kristiansen told reporters it is an Asian group that already operates in Europe, though not in retail.  New Look sells women’s clothing, footwear and accessories priced at the discount end of the spectrum, putting it head-to-head with the likes of Primark in an increasingly competitive market.  According to its full-year results for the 52 weeks to 29th March 2014, the retailer booked a GBP 64.20 million write-down on Mim which pushed the group to a loss before tax of GBP 55.00 million, compared to a pre-tax profit of GBP 3.10 million the previous year.  This prompted the company to start exploring strategic options for the French unit, including a sale.  The UK remains New Look’s mainstay market, and it is also looking to build the brand both online and overseas, namely in China, Poland, Russia and Germany.  For the 13 weeks to 28th June 2014 the group booked an 11.6 per cent increase in like-for-like sales at home and of 39.2 per cent in ecommerce sales, showing that this strategy is paying off.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were up 18.8 per cent at GBP 59.40 million and the retailer posted an underlying profit of GBP 43.60 million.  New Look, which is backed by private equity firms Apax Partners and Permira, is believed to have been looking to float on the stock market since the end of 2013, but these plans were dealt a blow with the disappointing full-year results.   Kristiansen said the company may not be ready for an initial public offering for as much as three years while it tries to build its presence overseas.  Even with its solid first quarter results, the chief executive said New Look is no nearer to a listing, noting that while the decision is down to investors and shareholders he does not see it happening any time soon.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The private equity investor is purchasing the US-based target to expand its existing Verscend healthcare information technology business.   Veritas will combine the two groups following completion, which is expected during the fourth quarter of 2018, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.   Under the terms of the agreement, the buyout firm is paying USD 44.75 per share in cash through its Vercend business to Cotiviti stockholders, representing a premium of 32.0 per cent to the last unaffected price on 4th June 2018.   Scrips in the target closed up 10.3 per cent to USD 43.99 following the announcement yesterday, which valued the group at USD 4.09 billion.   Cotiviti and Vercend will together operate as a private healthcare information technology company, while building a larger market presence by increasing affordability, reducing waste and improving outcomes.   The target, which claims to serve the majority of the top 25 US payers in the sector, provides payment accuracy, helping companies to achieve business objectives.   Cotiviti made its stock market debut in May 2016, raising USD 237.50 million through an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.

Some 11.17 million stocks are to be issued. The price is not disclosed, but may be valued at AUD 1.02 million (USD 1.04 million) given yesterday’s closing price of 9.10 Australian cents.  Carnavale is also to receive two USD 1.00 million cash payments to come from hydrocarbon production arising from a well drilled in 2010.   ADX will gain a 20.0 per cent working interest in the Lambouka project, which lies across the Italian and Tunisian national boundary in water 400.00 metres deep. The Western Australia-based  firm already operates the asset via its Alpine Oil and Gas subsidiary.  Carnavale stated it believes the next exploration stage at the property is likely to involve “significant cost”. The work may include drilling a sidetrack wellbore by re-entering the existing well and carrying out additional tests on the potential discovery found at the Lambouka number one well.  The possible high costs have come about as a result of difficulties encountered in previous drilling. Wellbore deterioration meant flow testing was abandoned, and the way forward is not certain.  Nevertheless, a gas column was interpreted at the site based on logging while drilling and wireline logging data collected during the initial drilling.  ADX will hold a 50.0 per cent stake in the prospect area upon completion of the deal, and the company stated it feels the project and the nearby Dougga prospect “represent a material appraisal and development opportunity”.  The oil and gas exploration and appraisal enterprise holds a number of other assets, including the Kerkouane permit and the Pantelleria licence, both located in the Sicily Channel.

Hong Kong-headquartered investment holding company Hutchison is unlikely to oppose the deal, as it will probably assist in the receipt of approval for its own takeover of O2, the Telegraph stated.   In May 2015 the FT reported Tesco was in talks regarding a sale of the mobile unit, thought to be worth in the region of hundreds of millions of pounds.  UK-based Tesco Mobile provides telecommunications services nationally via networks rented from O2.   According to its website, it serves around 4.00 million customers and operates from 320 Tesco retail outlets across the country.   It offers pay as you go, monthly and SIM only contracts, as well as 4G coverage.   As well as its supermarket and mobile activities, the Tesco group also provides banking services.

Maxim Group is the sole bookrunning manager to the share sale. Upon completion, the company’s stock will be listed on Nasdaq under the symbol GLMD.  As the initial filing is used to calculate registration fees, the final amount raised could change.   Tel Aviv-headquartered Galmed develops and commercialises a novel, once-daily, oral therapy for treating liver diseases and cholesterol gallstones using a family of synthetic fatty-acid/bile acid conjugates.  The company’s first product candidate is aramchol, which it says has the potential to modify fatty liver disorders, including non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis, or NASH, a chronic disease classed as a large unmet clinical need.  NASH is a severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that is characterised by inflammation in the organ due to excessive fat.  As it advances and damages cells it can eventually lead to serious problems such as cirrhosis, carcinoma and end-stage liver disease.  In the filing, Galmed said it is initially developing aramchol for the treatment of NASH in high-risk patients suffering from obesity and insulin resistance, and in the second quarter of this year plans to start randomised, placebo-controlled, varying dosage phase IIb trials for 240 such people.  So far, the product has been deemed appropriate by the Federal Drug Administration, as well as regulators in the UK, Germany and France.  Proceeds of the IPO will be used for clinical trials and product development, including around USD 10.00 million for starting and completing the phase IIb test of aramchol.

       " 'Ares Management is on the verge of unveiling the acquisition of real estate fund manager Area Property Partners in a move which would turn the US investment firm into a sizeable property player, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported.  People with knowledge of the matter told the newspaper an announcement could come as early as today, but they could not give terms of the deal.  However, the sources did say that as part of the transaction Ares has persuaded National Australia Bank to transfer its minority stake, a sale which would effectively end a two year strategic partnership.  The acquisition would bolster the asset manager’s profile in the property industry at a time when the sector has started to enjoy increasing attention from large private equity firms, the WSJ reported.  It said commercial prices have been rising the last four years, and added that TPG and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts are currently raising their first dedicated real estate funds.  Area Property was founded in 1993 by prominent US property investor William Mack and the private equity powerhouse Apollo Global Management under the name Apollo Real Estate Advisors.   Today, the company has overseen multiple real estate funds and joint ventures, through which it has spent roughly USD 14.00 billion in more than 600 transactions with an aggregate value in excess of USD 70.00 billion.   Its investment offerings have expanded from initial global opportunistic funds to include a broad range of regionally focused value-added and debt investment vehicles throughout North America, Europe, and India, according to its website.  Area Property has its headquarters in New York, and maintains domestic offices in Atlanta, Purchase and San Francisco, as well as overseas branches in London, Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam, Luxembourg and Mumbai.  International lender National Australia Bank, billed as one of Australia’s largest listed institutions, acquired a 35.0 per cent non-controlling interest in Area Property in March 2011 for an undisclosed sum.  Area Property has a diverse investor base consisting of government and corporate pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and high net worth families.   According to the website, since inception, more than 175 global institutional players and many more high net worth individuals have committed roughly USD 13.00 billion to the group’s fund vehicles and managed accounts.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Airline operator Aeroméxico is planning an initial public offering (IPO) on the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV) as part of an MXN 16.00 billion (USD 1.34 billion) investment programme aimed at purchasing 20 planes.  The company expects to raise up to MXN 2.38 billion by placing 970.45 million shares priced in the range of MXN 30.00 to MXN 34.00 apiece.  Aeroméxico is looking for domestic investors to subscribe to the offer. Existing stockholders will retain interests in the business, with a group of Mexican backers continuing to run the business in terms of both owning the controlling stake and managing operations.  Banamex, Actinver and Deutsche Securities, who are acting as underwriters on the flotation, may purchase units under an over-allotment option valued at MXN 357.66 million.  The 20 aircraft bought under the investment programme comprise ten Embraer 190 commercial jets, which have 98 to 114 seats, and ten Boeing 737s. By purchasing the planes, Aeromexico will save maintenance and fuel costs, thereby strengthening its balance sheet.  The group also announced plans to start routes to new domestic airports such as Huatelco, Colima and Tepic, as well as stepping up the frequency of flights to US destinations like Miami and San Antonio.  Aeroméxico is composed of four businesses, of which the best-known is the transcontinental carrier of the same name. The other firms cover regional and charter travel and maintenance.   As well as a wide range of Mexican cities, the operator flies to destinations across the Americas and the Caribbean, Europe and Asia.  Recent IPOs on the BMV include the MXN 9.74 billion flotation of airport operator OHL México in November and Grupo Sports World’s MXN 857.50 million debut a month earlier.

       " 'Leonard Green & Partners is looking to make a return on United States Infrastructure Corporation (USIC) via an auction potentially worth USD 2.00 billion including debt, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  The four-year-old portfolio company is touted at the largest provider of underground telecommunications, power and water utility line location and damage prevention services in North America.  Headquartered in Indianapolis, USIC has more than 7,500 technicians looking after infrastructure assets in over 30 US states and one Canadian province – cables need to be located and marked before any excavation can go ahead.  Sources told Reuters USIC has 12-month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of about USD 150.00 million.  The company, as it stands today, dates to 2008 when Kohlberg bought and merged two companies operating in the sector, namely SM&P Utility Resources and Central Locating Service.  According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, the private equity firm acquired the former from Laclede, now known as Spire, for USD 85.00 million and the latter from Asplundh Tree Expert for USD 35.00 million.  In 2010 Kohlberg sold the combined entity, USIC, to Omers Private Equity, which in turn exited in 2013 in a sale Reuters said was worth USD 740.00 million including debt.   Reuters’ article yesterday indicated Leonard has hired an investment bank to run the sale, which comes as USIC may benefit from a boost in demand for services on the back of the US’ proposal to increase infrastructure spending.  At the news provider’s valuation of USD 2.00 billion, this USIC sale would rank alongside Ascend Learning and EagleClaw Midstream, two deals featuring exits which were 1 this year, Zephyr shows.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Shares in UK-based Kewill, a logistics firm which supplies the likes of FedEx, were up 26.5 per cent at their high point today on news of a possible buyout.  The group’s board “received a preliminary approach which may or may not lead to an offer being made,” it told investors in an announcement at 9:19 am BST.  Just over an hour later Kewill confirmed an indicative bid of 130.00 pence per scrip but said the would-be buyer – which was not named – had not agreed a public announcement.  “Shareholders should be aware that there is no certainty that an offer will be made. Further updates will be announced as appropriate,” Kewill added.  Its stock reached a high of 126.50 pence on the announcement after closing at 100.00 pence yesterday. According to Bloomberg data, it enjoyed the largest gain since 2002.  An offer of 130.00 pence values Kewill at GBP 116.75 million and puts a 30.0 per cent premium on yesterday’s close.  Bloomberg cited Simon Strong, an analyst with KBC Peel Hunt, as saying SAP or Oracle Corporation could be behind the move.  He rates Artington-based Kewill as “buy” and believes “it has a very strong product and a very defined niche”.   “It has consistently won contracts against both [SAP and Oracle],” Bloomberg quoted the KBC analyst as saying.  The target reported an increase in recurring revenue streams in a trading statement for the year to 31st March. It will report full results on 21st June.  “Despite the difficult economic environment, the sales pipeline has remained good throughout the year”, it added.  While some spending has weakened, other customers have used slower trading as an opportunity to update their software systems.  Kewill had a cash balance of GBP 17.00 million as at 31st March 2010 – more than four times the GBP 4.00 million held at the end of March 2009. Around half of this gain can be attributed to a fundraiser earlier this year aimed at financing future acquisitions.   Strong will advise shareholders not to accept less than 175.00 pence per scrip, Bloomberg noted.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'GrainCorp has agreed to partner up with a consortium led by Australian Grains Champion to acquire and potentially list Co-operative Bulk Handling (CBH), Australia’s largest grain exporter.  Under the terms of the transaction, the agribusiness investor will inject AUD 300.00 million (USD 214.22 million) into a vehicle to help fund the buyout.  This will ensure that GrainCorp will receive an equity stake in CBH, should the farmer-controlled crop handler agree to an initial public offering (IPO).  Australian Grains Champion is presenting a proposal worth around AUD 1.00 billion to the target’s board, comprising two tranches of a guaranteed AUD 600.00 million in cash and up to AUD 400.00 million at the time of the listing.  The buyer said the takeover would release a large amount of cash and shares directly to CBH members, while also creating an Australian grains juggernaut.  HRL Morrison & Co has also agreed to take part in the acquisition and will invest a further AUD 300.00 million.  Reuters picked up on the investment and cited analysts as saying CBH could be worth as much as AUD 3.00 billion. At this price GrainCorp would likely be given a 20.0 per cent stake.  The Western Australian co-operative confirmed that it had received the non-binding indicative proposal and has appointed Deutsche Bank and King & Wood Mallesons to advise on the review.  CBH noted that the offer is complex and could take several weeks to assess.  An analyst at RBS Morgans told Reuters that large global agribusinesses would be attracted to the target due to its leading position in Australia’s grain sector.  GrainCorp, which was almost acquired by US giant Archer Daniels Midland for AUD 2.80 billion in 2013 before the Australian government rejected the proposal, is in pole position to buy CBH, the source said.  The target claims to be Australia’s largest co-operative and the leader in the grain industry, with operations including storage, handling, transportation and processing among its offering.  CBH has total assets worth over AUD 2.00 billion and employs around 1,100 staff at offices in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Portland.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'UK telecoms firm TalkTalk is currently leading the field in the race to acquire Tesco’s Blinkbox video streaming subsidiary, two people in the know told the Financial Times (FT).  According to the sources, an announcement could be made as early as next week.  A deal would have benefits for both Tesco and TalkTalk.  The former would be able to concentrate on its core grocery retail operations by jettisoning a loss-making division, while the latter will reinforce and grow the customer base of its television unit, which the FT named as the fastest-growing business of its kind in the UK.  However, an agreement is by no means guaranteed as the financial daily’s sources cautioned that negotiations have not yet been concluded and may still fall through.  No financial details have been disclosed at this time, but the people said the consideration is likely to be quite small as Blinkbox is not profitable.  None of the companies involved have commented on the report.  This is the second time Blinkbox has been the subject of speculation in 2014. In October the Times said Tesco had put the business on the block as part of a strategic review, adding that if a buyer could not be found it was likely the company would be closed down.  However, it did not take long to pique the interest of certain parties; earlier this month the Guardian said UK telecoms giant Vodafone was mulling a purchase and had held talks on the matter.  It is not known whether the Newbury-based group is still in the running.  Tesco bought an 80.0 per cent stake in Blinkbox from Eden Ventures and Nordic Venture Capital in April 2011 in a bid to enhance its digital entertainment activities.  However, the move has been less than successful, with significant losses being recorded, and the FT said chief executive Dave Lewis is expected to announce exits from peripheral businesses next week.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The paper noted the Mumbai-based company is exploring a sale in a bid to bring in some much needed cash as it struggles against a backdrop of slowdown in the domestic market and losses from its European businesses.  In December, media reports said Termomeccanica is eyeing the Indian group’s Italian subsidiary Franco Tosi Meccanica which is currently facing financial woes.  Parvez Umrigar, group director of Gammon India, told ET it needs to raise at least INR 10.00 billion (USD 181.31 million) to pare debt and pave the way for its next phase of growth.  He added the company is exploring the possibility of divesting stakes in the holding companies of other businesses such as real estate and power equipment, as well as some of its special purpose vehicles.  Gammon Infrastructure was formed by the parent group in 2001 to develop projects on a public-private partnership basis across a wide spectrum of sectors, including roads and expressways, airports, water and railways.  For the nine months to 31st December 2012 the company reported total income from operations of INR 918.95 million, compared with INR 731.25 million for the same period in 2011.  Umrigar told the ET that as Gammon Infrastructure is one of the group’s most mature businesses it would be easier to unlock value, adding that of its 75.0 per cent stake in the unit “we would be comfortable diluting up to 51.0 per cent”.  However, in a statement to the stock exchange, the Bombay-listed subsidiary sought to play down the report, saying it has “not been informed of any move by Gammon India Limited to sell any stake in the company.”  At its last closing price of INR 11.56 yesterday, a 24.0 per cent stake in Gammon Infrastructure is worth around INR 2.02 billion.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

NWT Uranium is seeking shareholders’ approval for the removal of the non-executive director and the current chairman, with Guy Elliot taking over the latter position, and the expansion of the board of directors.  It also wants backers to vote against a proposed private placement which, it said, will “result in a massive unnecessary and unfair dilution of existing shareholders”.

Earlier this month Niger Uranium resolved in principle to raise GBP 2.50 million by means of an equity placing with third-party investors. Terms are still to be finalised.   Proceeds would be used to provide further funding for the development of the group’s uranium projects in Niger and the Henkries Project in Namibia.

The Hamilton-based buyer is to pay USD 109.70 million, USD 70.20 million of which will be settled in cash. Newly-issued stock makes up the remainder of the consideration.  Watervale Proprietary, in which Aquarius holds a 47.0 per cent indirect interest, holds the remaining 26.0 per cent share.  The platinum group metal (PGM) mineral rights which the acquiror receives as a result of the deal concern prospecting activities in two properties situated in South Africa’s Bushveld Igneous Complex. The site is the world’s principal PGM source.  Afarak currently holds 100.00 per cent of one of the licence areas, Hoedspruit, which contains 6.22 million ounces of indicated and 1.01 million ounces of inferred PGM resources. The area is close to Rustenburg in North West Province.  It has the right to earn a 50.0 per cent stake in the other site, Kruidfontein. The property has some 4.29 million ounces of indicated and 41.11 million ounces of inferred PGM resources.  As part of the transaction, Aquarius has the right to spend USD 15.00 million of the latter licence area’s exploration expenditure on purchasing a 50.0 per cent stake in the site. The additional deal, which is not obligatory, would be carried out via Afarak.  Stuart Murray, chief executive of the Hamilton-based buyer, said: “The acquisition of these properties, and in particular the Rustenburg area property, greatly enhances the strategic options for the company into the future, and the purchase price is attractive for the quantity and quality of the ounces acquired.  “This purchase is another example of the implementation of our strategy to grow our resource, reserve and future production base by opportunistic acquisition.”  Six metals make up the platinum group: platinum itself and palladium are the most abundant and economically significant, while their four co-products are rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium. The applications of these rare metals include catalytic convertors, jewellery, chemical processing and fuel cells.  According to Platinum Today, platinum was priced at USD 1,787.00 per troy ounce today, 6.7 per cent higher than the USD 1,675.00 per troy ounce average over the last 12 months.

The purchase price represents about 1.45x the target’s actual tangible book value as of year-end 2016 and is subject to closing price adjustments.  Ironshore was taken over by Fosun last year when the group picked up the remaining 80.0 per cent stake it did not own in the company through its Mettlesome Investments for USD 2.10 billion.  The vendor is reportedly seeking an exit after a ratings firm had concerns about the parent company’s financial strength.  Liberty Mutual, a diversified insurer with operations in 29 countries, has been focused on expanding its operations in the area and will control Ironshore as a wholly owned subsidiary with its existing management team and brand.  Closing is slated for the first half of 2017, subject to regulatory approvals.  David Long, chief executive of Liberty Mutual, noted: “Ironshore has a track record of profitably underwriting global and diverse specialty risks insurance and is an ideal complement to Liberty Mutual, providing additional scale, expertise, innovation and market relationships to our USD 5.00 billion global specialty business.”  Founded in 2006, Ironshore has gross premiums written of USD 2.20 billion in 2015 and claims to be one of the ten largest excess and surplus lines insurers in the US.  The company has about 800 employees across 15 countries worldwide.  When Ironshore was purchased by Fosun last year, the buyer did not file for approval form the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US.

Therefore, to ensure it would be given the green light on the Ironshore acquisition, Fosun agreed to offload Wright to Starr Companies.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Indian vaccine producer Serum Institute of India is in talks with undisclosed private equity investors and sovereign wealth funds regarding the disposal of a stake in the firm, Bloomberg reported, citing chief executive Adar Poonawalla.  In an interview earlier this week, he said Cyrus Poonawalla is looking to offload between 5.0 and 10.0 per cent at a company valuation of up to INR 800.00 billion (USD 12.15 billion), meaning the sale of the higher shareholding could be worth about INR 80.00 billion.  According to Bloomberg, Serum is holding discussions with potential investors based in Singapore and the US and a decision is due to be made over the next couple of months.  “We’re just waiting to hear back from the funds on their conditions and their valuations and what they would expect”, Adar Poonawalla told the news provider.  Under the terms of the sale, he said an investor could have the option to exit their stake in seven years’ time, possibly through a merger or an initial public offering.   Bloomberg also reported the firm is considering the acquisition of smaller vaccine businesses, valued at a maximum of USD 300.00 million.  Pune-based Serum is India’s top biotechnology company, according to its website.   It also claims to be the largest manufacturer of vaccines in the world, having made and sold more than 1.30 billion doses.   Its products include treatments for conditions such as polio, diphtheria and tetanus, which are distributed in around 140 countries.  According to Bloomberg, the company recorded sales of around INR 40.00 billion for the twelve months ending 31st March 2015.   In July 2012 Serum bought Netherlands-based vaccines and antibodies developer Bilthoven Biologicals for a total value of EUR 80.00 million in its first acquisition outside of India.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'UK food and beverage supplier Tate & Lyle is planning to sell a large share of its European bulk ingredients division Eaststarch in a bid to enhance its focus on its speciality food ingredients unit.  The London-headquartered firm signed an agreement with Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADMC) to re-align their corn wet milling joint venture (JV).  Tate & Lyle will reduce its footprint in its European bulk ingredients unit by exiting plants in Bulgaria, Turkey and Hungary for proceeds of around EUR 240.00 million in cash.  Completion is subject to regulatory clearances and the deal is expected to close this summer.  A sale significantly strengthens the company’s speciality unit by acquiring full ownership of its Slovakia-based production facility.  Tate & Lyle is also expected to exit its bulk sweeteners arm in Europe before a decision on potential future investment is required, a choice arising from the reform of the EU Sugar Regime in 2017.  ADMC and the company each own a 50.0 per cent stake in the JV, which was founded in 1992 and owns and operates three corn wet mills located in Slovakia, Bulgaria and Turkey, as well as having a 50.0 per cent equity share in the continent’s largest corn wet mill in Hungary.  Eaststarch’s products include a range of bulk ingredients that are sold to a number of multinational, regional food and industrial customers.  The division generated operating profit of GBP 107.00 million and gross assets of GBP 518.00 million in the fiscal year ended 31st March 2014.  Due to lower sugar prices in Europe Tate & Lyle expect Eaststarch’s financials in FY 2015 to be around 23.0 per cent lower.  In an announcement filed with the London Stock Exchange, the London-listed vendor said the reform of the EU Sugar Regime in 2017 brings potential need for capital investment in bulk sweeteners.  Tate & Lyle’s strategy since 2010 has been to grow its speciality food segment and therefore the re-alignment of the JV comes at a good time for the company to realise good value for its assets.  In a concurrent transaction the group has agreed to restructure its Splenda Sucralose business to focus on areas where it sees value and to lower the manufacturing cost base of the unit by combining all production into its US facility.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'China Aoyuan Group is a step closer to spinning off Aoyuan Healthy Life (AHLG) as the property management subsidiary has submitted a post hearing information pack to the Hong Kong bourse.  Details of the global offering for the Cayman Islands-incorporated business are not yet known.  AHLG offers residential and non-residential property management and commercial operational activities for shopping malls, with a focus on mid to high-end and mixed-use developments in China.  With regards to the first business segment, options include: sales assistance such as cleaning and security of pre- and post- display units and home living support.  In terms of commercial operational activities, the company offers market positioning and tenant sourcing, among other things.  AHLG provided services to 61 sites in 25 cities across 11 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as of 30th September 2018.  Furthermore, the group ranked second and third among commercial operational players in southern China and Guangdong province, respectively, and served eight shopping malls in six cities, at the end of September.   As at 30th September 2018, it had return on assets of 15.1 per cent, return on equity of 72.5 per cent, a current ratio of 1.2 per cent and liabilities to assets ratio of 0.7 per cent.   AHLG intends to scale up activities in cities where it can achieve higher profit margins and expand its portfolio: the group booked net profit of CNY 59.60 million on revenue of CNY 279.48 million in the first nine months of 2018.  China Aoyuan owns 75.5 per cent of AHLG and intends to retain an interest of no less than 50.0 per cent following the spin-off and listing.   The group decided to pursue a separation as the subsidiary had grown to a point which merited a listing to create a more defined business focus and efficient allocation of resources.  In addition, a spin-off will unlock shareholder value and create an investor base for AHLG, which will then have financial flexibility.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Beleaguered Australian oil and gas producer Santos said it has rejected a AUD 7.14 billion (USD 5.15 billion) takeover offer from an investment firm with ties to Asia and the Middle East.  In a stock exchange filing today, the Adelaide-based group confirmed it has fielded an indicative, highly conditional and non-binding proposal from Scepter Partners worth AUD 6.88 per share in cash, a 26.5 per cent premium to its last close.  Based in Bermuda, the bidder is an investment company in which stakeholders include a syndicate of ruling families, ultra-high net-worth industrialists and sovereign wealth funds.    Santos said it believes the offer to be “opportunistic in nature” and does not reflect fair value for its assets.  Following the statement, shares in the oil producer leapt by as much as 21.0 per cent in early trading, before paring gains to close 16.2 per cent higher at AUD 6.32.  This is the first direct approach for Santos since it announced a strategic review in August and put a number of assets on the block in an effort to raise money to cut its AUD 8.80 billion debt-load.  The company, which has interests in Australia, Indonesia and Vietnam and recently started production at its Gladstone liquefied natural gas project in Queensland, has been hit hard by the slump in global oil prices.  It posted an 82.0 per cent drop in profits to AUD 37.00 million for the six months to 30th June 2015, from AUD 206.00 million in H1 2014.  Santos noted the offer from Scepter is “subject to numerous conditions, some of which would be adverse to Santos continued evaluation of other alternatives in its current strategic review process.”  However, analysts predict that the investment outfit is likely to sweeten its bid and view this opening gambit as the start of negotiations.  The current slump in global crude prices makes the oil and gas industry a buyer’s market and many financial and trade players are taking advantage of the downturn to snap up assets more cheaply than would otherwise have been the case.   Last month Papua New Guinean producer Oil Search knocked back an AUD 11.60 billion approach from Woodside Petroleum.  Scepter has an impressive array of backers and counts Prince Abdul Ali Yil Kabier and Prince Bahar Bolkiah, both members of the Brunei royal family, and Sheikh Juma al Maktoum, an uncle of the crown prince of Dubai, as directors.  It is chaired by Sir John Bond, who previously held the same role at Glencore Xstrata.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The company will hold the worldwide rights to the treatment, except in the US, Japan and South Korea, to help people suffering with chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) in dialysis patients.   CKD-aP is an intractable systemic itch condition that occurs with high frequency and intensity in patients undergoing treatment for kidney disease.  Under the terms of the agreement, Cara will receive an upfront payment of USD 50.00 million in cash and an equity investment of USD 20.00 million, whereby Vifor will have the chance to acquire common stock in the pharmaceuticals group at USD 17.00 apiece.   In addition, the firm will also be able to receive additional payments of up to USD 470.00 million, including USD 30.00 million in regulatory and up to USD 440.00 million in tiered commercial milestones that are all sales related.   The Korsuva injection has already been granted breakthrough therapy designation by the US Food and Drug Administration.   Cara will retain full development and commercialisation rights for the treatment of CKD-aP in the US, except in the clinics of Fresenius Medical Care North America, which is the largest kidney dialysis provider in the country, treating 38.0 per cent of patients undergoing dialysis in 2017.  Stefan Schulze, president of the executive committee at Vifor, noted that between 60.0 and 70.0 per cent of people undergoing the kidney treatment suffer from CKD-aP.  He added: “Nearly 20.0 per cent suffer from a very severe form, which is associated with much lower survival. And despite this clear unmet medical need, there is no approved treatment for CKD-aP in Europe or the US.”  Korsuva does not penetrate the brain and therefore bypasses unwanted side-effects like opioid addiction.

       " 'Swiss cruise ship operator MSC Crociere might increase its interest in two Italian tour companies, according to an unsourced report from Milano Finanza (MF) newspaper.  MSC wants to up its current minority stake in Milanese tour operator Bluvacanze and Turin-based counterpart Cisalpina to 51.0 per cent, the report said.  The Geneva-based bidder has beaten rival suitors from Italy and overseas, MF noted. It has the backing of Italian private equity group Investitori Associati, which previously held 85.0 per cent of Bluvacanze and bought Cisalpina three years ago.  Bluvacanze has also held shares in Cisalpina; in fact it bought the company with Investitori Associati in 2007.  Italian investment business Blu Holding, which was seeking funding from an initial public offering prior to the financial crisis, is currently the controlling shareholder of both Bluvacanze and Cisalpina.  Blu Holding bought the Milanese business from Barclays Private Equity for an undisclosed sum in 2005. In turn Barclays paid GBP 20.00 million for a 42.0 per cent stake in 2000 and backed a management buyout three years later.  Cisalpina was worth USD 245.70 million in revenue in 2009, while Bluvacanze generated USD 250.76 million.  MSC claims to be the market leading cruise operator in the Mediterranean, South Africa and Brazil.   It has 11 ships, which carried 1.20 million people last year and has invested EUR 5.50 billion in its fleet since 2003.  The group has been affected by political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, and has rearranged the schedules of cruises to Tunisia, Egypt and Bahrain for its summer 2011 and winter 2011-12 seasons.

Other possible contenders include the ICB’s German counterpart Schufa, as well as Crif in Italy and the Irish financial services group Fexco, Business World said, citing a separate news report.  The ICB was established in 1965 to provide information to lenders and is owned and financed by the members it serves. Major shareholders include Allied Irish Banks (AIB), Lomard and Bank of Ireland.  Business World claimed AIB, a 12.0 per cent ICB investor, instigated a review of the organisation last year.  Back in 2006 there was talk of Fexco taking it on for between EUR 90.00 million and EUR 100.00 million.  The ICB generated EUR 8.63 million in revenue in 2007, the most recent year for which records are available.   This was the fourth successive period of growth, with the figure having increased by two thirds between 2003 and 2007 (FY 2006: EUR 7.01 million; FY 2005; EUR 7.36 million; FY 2004: EUR 6.06 million; FY 2003: EUR 5.29 million).  AIB suffered a 57.2 per cent decline in earnings last year, with net profit plunging from EUR 2.07 billion to EUR 855.00 million.

       " 'An initial public offering (IPO) could be on the menu for Nando’s, the South African casual dining restaurant chain known for its flame-grilled, peri-peri chicken, sources close to the situation told Bloomberg.  The people, who declined to be named as the matter is still private, said while the Mozambican/Portuguese themed fast food company is speaking to advisors, a final decision is yet to be made.  Plans for returning to the stock market include a share sale on the London Stock Exchange, among other possible bourses, but discussions are still in the early stages and the franchise may consider other fundraising methods.  Bloomberg added proceeds from an overseas listing would not only provide Nando’s with access to currency other than South Africa’s volatile Rand but also give it a chance to open up its capital to a large investor base.  It certainly would not be one of the country’s first companies to either eye up an overseas IPO or move its primary listing to another international exchange.  For example, at the end of 2015 Steinhoff International Holdings restructured to form a Dutch holding entity in a bid to move its quotation to the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.  However, a spokesman rejected the 0, telling Bloomberg in an emailed statement that not only is speculation about an IPO incorrect but the chain is not even looking into ways of raising money.  When contacted by the Telegraph, which followed up on the news providers report, the representative said: \"Nando’s is a privately owned business that is still owned by the entrepreneurs who set up the business in the first place.”  The chain was established in in South Africa in the late 1980’s by entrepreneurs Robbie Brozin and Fernando Duarte, with backing from local billionaire businessman Richard Enthoven.  It originally traded on Johannesburg’s stock exchange up until 2003, in which time the restaurant had established a presence in the UK.  Today, Nando’s is known for its flame-grilled chicken marinated in peri-peri, the Swahili word pepper-pepper, which is a hot sauce prevalent in South Africa and Mozambique, among other countries.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Russian state-owned JSC Atomredmetzoloto, and its affiliate Effective Energy, (collectively ARMZ) are hoping to win over minority investors with a cash bid of CAD 2.86 per share.  This deal, announced before Toronto opened this morning, for the remaining 48.6 per cent interest in one of the world’s largest, publicly-traded uranium producers is worth in the region of CAD 1.30 billion.  It represents a 32.0 per cent premium to the 20-day volume weighted average price and is also 18.7 per cent higher than the close of CAD 2.41 on 14th January.  Leila Kulbayeva, mining and industrials research director at Viso Capital, told Bloomberg that ARMZ is aiming to create a company covering the full nuclear cycle, from mining to building reactors, and may be looking to take advantage of reduced uranium prices following the Fukushima disaster.  In an e-mailed response to questions from the news provider, she said the bid is lower than the investment bank’s target price of CAD 5.03 per share and advises shareholders not to accept the offer.  She added Viso Capital is confident Uranium One would have sound production growth and continue enjoying one of the lowest costs of uranium production in the world.  Uranium One is headquartered in Toronto but operates eight mines in three countries and manages the Mkuju River development project in Tanzania.

Its proposal represents a 50.0 per cent premium to Medivation’s two-month volume weighted average price (VWAP) prior to the takeover 0s.   Sanofi chief executive Olivier Brandicourt noted he made an initial approach in the middle of March but was subsequently rebuffed as the US business’ board had no interest in meeting up or hearing about an offer.  Undaunted, the French pharmaceutical major decided to send a letter on 15th April outlining its USD 52.50 apiece proposal but, other than acknowledging it had received the message, Medivation has remained in stony silence.  Sanofi is pushing for the public takeover as it believes the San Francisco-headquartered company, as a cancer-focused developer, would play an important role in its 2020 plan.  This programme includes a mid-term strategy to rebuild its position in the field of oncology, one of the largest and fastest growing therapeutic areas in the biopharmaceutical sector, according to Brandicourt.

Colas is looking to secure its supply of bitumen, and SRD produces 300,000 tonnes of the tar-like petroleum each year.  Total has already said it is willing to sell its 40.0 per cent stake to Colas, and according to the would-be buyer, the deal could be wrapped up by the second half of 2009.  “In order to ensure the continuity of production at the SRD site, Colas would sign an assistance agreement with one of the current partners, notably in terms of supply and technical assistance,” it noted.  Boulogne-Billancourt-based Colas is an engineering firm specialising in road works. It produces aggregates, emulsions and asphalt mix, but has little experience in oil refinery.  It works on five continents, with business in waterproofing, railways and pollution clean-up, and generated EUR 12.08 billion in revenue in 2007 after an annual increase of 9.8 per cent.

It said the decision to call in administrators came after a strategic review taken in conjunction with Zeus Capital; the move enables it to focus on another subsidiary Micro Materials and should stabilise its own financial position.  In a statement yesterday the administrator revealed all the staff at the firm have been made redundant.

       " 'Australian buyout player Pacific Equity Partners (PEP) is on the verge of exiting Braiform by selling the clothes hanger and merchandise packaging supplier to managers, a source with knowledge of the situation told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).  While financial information regarding the acquisition is not yet known, the newspaper noted the portfolio company has annual earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of about AUD 6.00 million (USD 5.79 million).

Meanwhile, Hong Kong-based Ben Hunt will leave his five-year old post in the development office to helm the business’ overall operations.  PEP took on Braiform as part of its acquisition of Australian facilities manager Spotless Group for more than AUD 700.00 million in 2012 and, according to the WSJ, has been running it with different management as a separate company.  Earlier this year, sources told the newspaper the private equity firm has received a number of approaches for the supplier and noted Investec would likely advise on the exit.  Braiform incorporates the Braitrim and Plastiform brands and makes customised clothes hangers and packaging, such as gift and suit bags and boxes, for niche and mass retailers as well as apparel manufacturers.  The group’s UK customers include Marks and Spencer, Next and Superdry while US clients range from Costco, Nike and Target, among others.

       " 'UK-based insurer Aviva intends to list its Dutch subsidiary Delta Lloyd Verzekeringen to boost its own capital base, it confirmed today on announcing half-year results.  The group is planning a partial initial public offering (IPO) for the 92.0-per cent-owned subsidiary, which will debut on Euronext Amsterdam when market conditions allow.   Aviva did not provide a timeframe or suggest how much it hopes to raise, but did confirm its intention to list at least a quarter of Delta Lloyd.  Andrew Moss, group chief executive, said the move comes as part of an initiative to “transform Aviva for the future”. It follows a monolithic marketing campaign announcing the name change from Norwich Union earlier this year.   “This [the IPO] will enable Aviva to free up capital for use elsewhere and will allow Delta Lloyd to pursue its ambitions in the Benelux region,” Moss explained.  The Delta Lloyd brand name can trace its origins back to one of Europe’s oldest life insurers, Hollandsche Societeit van Levensverzekeringen.  Aviva claims to be one of the top five financial services providers in the Netherlands, with around GBP 40.00 billion in assets under management and a 6,400-strong workforce.  Its pre-tax earnings for the six months to 30th June were 12.0 per cent higher year-on-year on a market consistent embedded value (MCEV) basis, increasing from GBP 1.51 billion to GBP 1.69 billion.  It made a profit after tax (MCEV) of GBP 1.08 billion from a GBP 2.36 billion loss in the six months to 30th June 2008.  Moss said Delta Lloyd’s IPO – coupled with the planned sale of the Australian business – will “significantly increase” Aviva’s flexibility.  “Our overriding priority now is to continue to build a position of strength from which Aviva can exploit market opportunities,” he noted.  It hopes to divest Aviva Australia by the end of September.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

       " 'German construction giant Hochtief has declared its interest in snapping up a holding in Cologne Bonn airport if it were to be privatised, according to local daily Handelsblatt.  The publication quotes Reinhard Kalenda, CEO of the Hotchief Airport division, as saying that the group \"would be one of the interested parties\" if the airport were to be privatised.  The Cologne Bonn Airport is the largest low-cost hub in Continental Europe. More than 9.9 million passengers took off from the airport to over 130 destinations in 2006, up from 9.479 million in 2005 and 8.406 million in 2004. By the end of this year the figure is set to be in excess of 10 million.  In terms of total air traffic, including both passenger and freight, Cologne Bonn ranks as the fourth-largest airport in Germany. Based purely on passenger numbers it ranks in sixth place and for freight it enters the ranking at second place.  The increase in passenger numbers at the airport is directly linked with the start-up of low-cost carriers. In 2002 Germanwings and TUfly commenced operations using the airport as their hub and were followed by easyJet in 2003 and Wizzair in the middle of last year.  In August logistics powerhouse FedEx disclosed plans to set up its new hub for Central and Eastern Europe at Cologne Bonn airport.  Cologn Bonn saw its turnover soar by 42.49 per cent in fiscal 2006 to USD 341.899 million and an improvement in its profit margin from 2.91 per cent to 3.56 per cent meant that earnings glided northwards to USD 6.611 million, up 86.12 per cent.  Hochtief is one of the leading international providers of construction-related services, generating sales of EUR 15.51 billion and consolidated net profit of EUR 89.1 million in 2006.   The report suggests that Hochtief plans to use its newly-acquired holding in the airport to build up services via cooperation with neighbouring Dusseldorf airport, in which it already has a cornerstone 20 per cent interest. Düsseldorf is Germany\\'s third-largest airport in terms of passengers, with only Munich and Frankfurt carrying more.

The target, which owns 385 megawatts of hydro capacity on ten river systems in five states, is being offloaded by private equity firm I Squared Capital’s ISQ Global Infrastructure Fund, which picked up the business in 2014 for an undisclosed amount.  OPG is making the investment through its US hydroelectric platform and is expecting the addition of Cube to provide additional scale and generate operational combinations between the two businesses for enhanced opportunities for further capital deployment.   The acquiror, which hired Goldman Sachs to advise on the matter, will finance the acquisition through its corporate debt programme, or other available credit facilities.   Founded in 2014, Cube has 19 hydropower facilities in-service capacity located in New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina.   Sadek Wahba, chairman of the buyout group which owns the target, observed: “This is the third portfolio company realisation in the last twelve months based on the I Squared Capital platform approach, with a total of over USD 2.80 billion in realised enterprise value.”   The company recently offloaded Lincoln Clean Energy to Ørsted and Amplus Solar to Petronas.

The news provider speculated the move could be a signal investor confidence may have returned by then after being shaken by recent turmoil in emerging markets.  Invepar is looking to raise somewhere in the region of BRL 2.00 billion (USD 821.80 million) from the stock offering, the source told Reuters, on condition of anonymity as the plans are still private.  The person noted an IPO could take place in May or June, when market conditions become more stable and constructive.  Reports of a flotation by Invepar have been circulating since 2011, when it was thought the company would make its public debut in 2012; however, plans have been put back a number of times.  It is thought that with the impending World Cup, and the Olympic Games in Rio just a couple of years away, the firm is now stepping up preparations for an IPO.  Reuters noted the delay in Invepar coming to the market comes as Brazilian companies face a fundraising conundrum this year against a backdrop of higher borrowing costs, weaker growth, presidential elections and the withdrawal of quantitative easing in the US.  The infrastructure business is controlled by an investment vehicle run by Banco do Brasil, state-controlled pension funds Petros and Funcef and construction major OAS, all of which wanted the firm to price an IPO by this month, the news provider said.  Founded in 2000, the Invepar group comprises 14 companies and among other things it operates an electronic toll payment system for roads in Brazil and Peru, provides rolling stock and systems for Rio de Janeiro’s Line 4 subway and manages São Paulo's international airport, the country’s busiest.

Commenting on the new development, managing director Alison Watkins stressed: “With a population of more than 240 million and a fast-growing emerging middle class, Indonesia is a key growth market for CCA.”  She noted that the company has crafted a plan to expand warehousing, important infrastructure and production, aiming to capture the growth opportunity in the country.  Going forward, CCA intends to launch a series of targeted marketing campaigns and introduce new products like Coke Life, a lower calorie and naturally sweetened drink, to cater to an increasingly health-conscious marketplace.

Under the terms of the transaction, the buyer is offering an initial USD 120.00 million in cash and a further USD 100.00 million as an earnout based on the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones.   MyoScience manufacturers the US Food and Drug Administration-approved iovera system for non-opioid pain control, associated with Osteoarthritis, that alleviates symptoms through a mechanism known as cryoanalgesia.   This process applies intensively cold therapy to a specific nerve to interrupt its ability to transmit a pain signal, with immediately effective results that can last up to three months.   Pacira believes the addition of MyoScience will boost net income in the second half of 2020 and increasingly thereafter.   Closing is slated for April 2019, following the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.   Following completion, the acquiror will change its name to Pacira BioSciences in order to better reflect a broadening portfolio of non-opioid pain management and regenerative health solutions.   Timothy Still, chief executive of MyoScience, said: “This acquisition comes at a time when opioid abuse and addiction has reached epidemic proportions and alternative approaches to pain management are being mandated.   “We believe adding iovera to EXPAREL-based opioid-sparing protocols will help create an opioid-free perioperative and postoperative experience for many patients.”  MyoScience’s main product has been used in over 20,000 procedures with a growing body of clinical evidence supporting efficacy.   Osteoarthritis is associated with a higher likelihood of opioid use with as many as 30.0 per cent of presurgical patients with end-stage knee, hip or spine osteoarthritis using prescription opioids, according to data published in Arthritis Care & Research.

       " 'UK-based electronics manufacturing business Stadium Group might sell its plastics division and is in late-stage negotiations with an interested party.   The unit comprises of Stadium Building Products and Quest Consumer Products, which are on the block as the Hartlepool-based firm focuses on its electronics and power supply activities.  “The talks are at an advanced stage and employee consultation regarding the possible sale is under way,” Stadium said.  Quest makes branded plastic products for high street retailers in the consumer baby care market. It had already suffered a 67.5 per cent decline in pre-tax earnings before the recession – from GBP 495.87 million in 2007 to EUR 161.01 million in 2008.   Stadium Building provides specialist plastic and ventilation products for the consumer DIY, building and construction markets, which have been badly bruised by the events of the last 18 months.  Group revenue fell 2.1 per cent in 2009 from GBP 47.61 million to GBP 46.58 million. It was the first year-on-year decline since 2004 and pushed net income 17.7 per cent lower from GBP 2.19 million to GBP 1.80 million.  There was some relief from the disappointing earnings results as Stadium significantly strengthened its borrowing position in 2009; net debt of GBP 2.06 million as at 31st December 2008 became a cash figure of GBP 0.40 million.   Against the difficult operating environment it would be wise for the group to maintain a strong balance sheet – and the sale of Stadium Building and Quest would go some way towards this end.  The news was well received by investors before the bank holiday break; it pushed Stadium stock 14.5 per cent higher in just 24 hours from a close of 55.00 pence on 27th May to 63.00 pence on 28th May.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Australian energy utility asset owner DUET Group today announced the launch of a rights issue which is to raise around AUD 277.00 million (USD 297.57 million).  Shareholders are entitled to one new stapled security for every five already held. At AUD 1.52 apiece, the new offer represents a 5.0 per cent discount to yesterday’s AUD 1.60 close.  An institutional entitlement offer will run today and tomorrow, with the retail entitlement offer taking place between 9th August and 25th August.  Chief executive David Bartholomew said the move is aimed at increasing stockholder value and reinforcing the company’s capital structure.  The issue achieves this by simplifying DUET’s asset portfolio, repaying all of its corporate-level debt, reducing the gearing of the Dampier Bunbury Pipeline (DBP) and cutting its own gearing to about 76.0 per cent.  Bartholomew commented that the offer would, along with planned capital initiatives, bring the company “in line with our listed peers”.  DUET owns assets in Australia and the US, including WA Gas Networks, the owner and operator of a gas distribution licence in Western Australia, and the DBP, the region’s main transmission pipeline.   It also owns the Multinet gas distribution business in Victoria, Pennsylvania electricity company Duquesne Light and United Energy Distribution, a utility supply network covering 1,472 square kilometres of south-eastern Melbourne and the Mornington Peninsula.  In the year to 30th June 2010 the company generated revenue of AUD 1.09 billion, up 7.9 per cent from AUD 1.01 billion in fiscal 2009. Net profit was AUD 173.75 million in FY 2010 compared to a loss of AUD 48.60 million a year earlier.   Basic and diluted earnings per share improved to 4.88 cents from a loss of 3.95 cents over the period.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Reports of a transaction emerged earlier this month when Expansión said the New York and Madrid-quoted company is interested in a purchase of the business, having received USD 5.00 billion from the sale of its stake in YFP Argentina.  A number of other possible targets, including Kodiak Oil & Gas, Pacific Rubiales Energy, Oasis Petroleum and Lundin Petroleum, were also named by the Spanish daily.  Based on Talisman Energy's closing share price of USD 11.16 on 3rd July, the last trading day prior to the initial report, the deal could be worth USD 5.52 billion.  The Calgary-headquartered target has now opted to respond to the news, confirming that Repsol has approached it with a number of possible transaction ideas.  While it confirmed the earlier report, the firm declined to comment any further at this point, aside from saying that there is no guarantee a deal will take place and a further statement will be released when appropriate.  Reuters has speculated that rather than an outright acquisition of Talisman Energy, various segments of the firm may be more attractive targets.   However, no precise details of the size of the stake being looked at were disclosed.  Repsol has also been linked with a number of potential sales this year; in March reports suggested it could look to offload its exploration and production unit.  Less than a month later competition authority la Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia said a divestment of 23 Spanish petrol stations may also be on the cards.  Founded in 1992, Talisman Energy is publicly-quoted in Toronto and New York.  In addition to its headquarters, the firm has four other offices in Canada and an international presence in the US, Indonesia, Australia and the UK, among others.

The deal received shareholder approval in November and 1 on 2nd January.  Commenting on the move, Josef Mandelbaum, chief executive of Perion, stated: “Our vast network of developer partners, our many end users and our shareholders will benefit from our increased scale, driving exceptional reach and strong market recognition as we emerge today as one of the largest global digital distribution and product companies in the world.\"  He added that the group will also be able to invest more in the mobile and data analytics sectors, which it believes will be key to its growth in the coming years.

The chief executive stated that the firm is not yet where it wants to be and plans to carry out more acquisitions and investments to continue its expansion.

People with knowledge of the matter told the news and information website the talks about a funding round worth at least USD 1.00 billion are still in the early-stages and as such may not go ahead.  TechCrunch confirmed the news, which was first reported by Axios, as its own sources said the bidirectional, all-electric, self-driving car startup is also sounding out interest from other potential investors.  So far Zoox has reportedly raised a little over USD 250.00 million in capital from the likes of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Lux Capital and Breyer Capital and currently has a valuation of roughly USD 1.50 billion.  TechCrunch reported creating self-driving cars from the ground up requires serious amounts of capital, and an equity injection would come at a time when competition to build prototypes is really stepping up.  Zoox was founded in 2014 by Tim Kentley-Klay and Jesse Levinson to develop breakthrough, fully automated, electric vehicles and the supporting ecosystem needed to bring the fleet to market at scale.  The robotics company is reluctant to reveal details on its development programmes and there is no information on its website.  However, TechCrunch reported the startup has poached computer vision, artificial intelligence, and automotive design employees from the likes of Apple and Alphabet to help look into setting up Uber-like services that will be purely automated.  In a meeting with IEEE Spectrum last year at Stanford, Kentley-Klay told the publication the idea is he wants to press a button on an app on his phone for one of Zoox’s autonomous vehicles.

The two firms are thought to be close to agreeing on the value of the stake in a deal which would see the London-based investment bank coming under the wing of the US financial affiliate before the end of the year, the paper said.  When JPMorgan and Cazenove formed the 50:50 joint venture in 2005 the agreement contained clauses which paved the way for a full-scale takeover after five years – due February 2010.  Under the initial terms of the contract the US conglomerate has an option to buy the British stockbroker out of JPMorgan Cazenove after an independent valuation of the business is carried out.  Sources close to the matter told the Independent both companies are keen to sign off a deal earlier than the original February deadline, for differing reasons which have not been specified, and the plans may be revealed to staff as early as next month.  An unidentified person said: \"Cazenove is having a barnstorming year and I don\\'t blame them for wanting to cash in. But JPMorgan isn\\'t daft. It will make sure it gets what it wants out of this deal too.\"  A spokesman, cited by the Daily Mail, confirmed talks had taken place. “JPMorgan and Cazenove have a continuing and constructive dialogue regarding the future shareholding structure of their joint venture.   “Any decisions about the future will be made in the best interests of shareholders, clients and staff.

These sources said the planned initial public offering (IPO) could happen in the coming months, capitalising on buoyant stock markets and the recent upturn in the value of shares of the big quoted buyout groups.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan are among favourites to handle the listing, the FT said, citing bankers.  Ares focuses on alternative credit-based strategies, spanning private equity, private debt and the capital markets, and is a Securities and Exchange Commission-registered investment advisor.  Headquartered in Los Angeles, the group has offices throughout the US as well as in Europe, Asia and Australia and employed roughly 560 people as of 31st December 2012.  Ares was founded by Antony Ressler and John Kissick, who were among the founders of Apollo and subsequently led the company’s capital markets business; in 1997 they spun out the division into a new entity.  While it has an active private equity and capital markets investment portfolio, the Los Angeles group specialises in credit, including corporate loans, bonds and structure finance; indeed, its US private debt arm Ares Capital Corporation is already publicly listed.  In 2007 Ares sold a stake in itself to Gulf-based sovereign wealth fund Abu Dhabi Investment Authority for USD 375.00 million, one of the first investment firms to open its capital to Middle Eastern funds.  A report by the Wall Street Journal at the time suggested the move could be a precursor to an IPO.  Ares would be following in the footsteps of buyout heavyweights Carlyle, Blackstone, Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts and Apollo, all of which opted to go public despite the fact that the nature of their business means that consistent returns are not guaranteed, the FT noted.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The group’s board has agreed to let it pursue public data network operator IGO Wireless, which operates fixed wireless data services, as well as the affiliate Instaconnect, an application service provider which integrates data.  Safaricom has been bolstering ICT activities for some time in an attempt to diversify revenue streams ahead of slowing growth in the mobile telecoms sector.   If the Nairobi-based telecoms firm does acquire IGO and Instaconnect, the purchases would come a year after an agreement to buy the data communications services firm Packet Stream Data Network.

It is not clear how much Vodafone-backed Safaricom is prepared to pay for the two businesses but, counting the world’s largest mobile phone company as a shareholder, the Kenyan firm has plenty of firepower behind it.

The quoted Israeli group, which traded 1.2 per cent higher at 13.27 pm on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), is planning to divest a 50.0 per cent stake in Gottex, a company established in 1949.  Africa Israel said that it will publish an announcement if and when a memorandum of understanding is signed. No other details were divulged.  Gottex, established by Leah and Ermine Gottleib as a raincoat company, is now claimed by Africa Israel to be the leading domestic swimwear manufacturer.  The division, which was bought by Africa Israel in 1997, designs beachwear through Gottex Models and Christina America.   It also markets clothing brands Zara, Pull and Bear and Massimo Dutti through a licence from Spain's Inditex.  Africa Israel is based in Yahud and has activities in the fields of real estate, energy, hotels and infrastructure among other things. It is owned by current chairman Lev Leviev.  It has five publicly-traded subsidiaries and three listed associated companies, all of which are on the TASE. The company has a wholly-owned unit quoted in London and two affiliated listed groups, one of which is listed in New York and another in London.  Africa Israel made a net loss of ILS 2.02 billion (GBP 368.94 million) in the first nine months of 2008, compared with a profit of around ILS 4.73 billion in the corresponding period last year.  It is planning to increase its liquidity by selling off properties and assets.

The lender went into receivership at the start of October after a run on deposits and could be nationalised.  Prominvestbank’s press secretary Svitlana Kushnir told Reuters it is looking for a buyer and could settle the matter in “the days to come”.  However, “there is no specific buyer” at present, Kushnir revealed.  According to the Kyiv Post, chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) Volodymyr Stelmakh questioned whether the state has enough funds to buy the firm.  \"It seems that bank had to become a national bank. But the question is whether there is money to nationalise it. If there is money, they are welcome to nationalise it,\" the paper quotes Stelmakh as saying.  A number of investors have expressed interest in buyer Prominvestbank, the NBU chairman noted, without revealing their identities.  The Kiev-based bank received a USD 1 billion bailout from the government at the end of September, when it had assets of UAH 27.6 billion (USD 4.73 billion).  Of this total, UAH 3.7 billion was its own capital and UAH 23.9 billion was owed to creditors.   Prominvestbank generated net earnings of UAH 234 million in 2007 after 9.0 per cent annual growth (FY 2006: UAH 213 million; FY 2005: UAH 220 million; FY 2004: UAH 111 million).

       " 'Publicly-listed Canadian natural resource company Spur Ventures is going to explore gold mines in Australia by snapping up Atlantic Gold through a scheme of arrangement.  Chatswood-based Atlantic Gold has a number of development-to-exploration properties in Nova Scotia, Canada, like Touquoy and Cochrane Hill. It will receive all of the cash flow once gold production has started.  Spur Ventures has been looking out for acquisition opportunities in gold, base metals or other mineral related assets or businesses, following the sale of its phosphate mining and fertiliser-related operations in China to Hong Tang Vision in 2012.  The Canadian company, which has about CAD 28.70 million (USD 26.13 million) in cash as its sole asset, has moved its listing from the Toronto Stock Exchange to TSX-V since then.  Under the scheme, Spur Ventures will issue 0.06 shares for each Atlantic Gold unit, giving an implied offer of AUD 0.04. This values the company at about AUD 31.11 million.  The friendly offer represents a 29.6 per cent bid premium over Atlantic Gold’s last close on 1st April.  Ronald Hawkes, chairman of Atlantic Gold, welcomed the deal which he described as an important first step towards the funding of the development of the Touquoy gold project, without diluting its share value by capital raising.   Au Mining, the parent of Atlantic Gold, will also support the takeover.  Going forward, Atlantic Gold has announced a security purchase plan to fund the explorer’s working capital requirements ahead of the merger.  The transaction is subject to the parties executing a legally binding agreement and approvals by shareholders and Australian court.  However, a backup plan is in place in the event of an unsuccessful public takeover. Atlantic Gold has agreed to sell DDV Gold, its wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, to Spur Ventures if the deal is rejected.

Moelis & Co has been advising Oslo-based Elkem on its options for several months, three people with knowledge of the matter told the news provider. Meanwhile, POSCO has mandated Citigroup, two other sources claimed.  The Asian steelmaking giant is looking to expand in renewable energy materials and its target has production facilities in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia. Not to mention an extensive network of sales offices with agents covering the most important markets and a staff of 2,500.  \"We are internally considering (the takeover),\" POSCO chief executive Chung Joon-yang told Reuters.  Elkem is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of environmentally friendly materials. Its main products are silicon, solar grade silicon and special alloys for the foundry industry, as well as microsilica and carbon.  It generated NOK 3.97 billion (USD 632.39 million) in 2009 revenue after a year-on-year decline of 15.5 per cent (FY 2008: NOK 4.70 billion). However, profitability improved considerably; the group recorded a NOK 1.16 billion net income from a NOK 391.00 million loss in 2009.  Reuters said a deal with POSCO would allow Elkem’s Oslo-based parent Orkla to improve its focus; the group is a conglomerate with investments ranging from financial services to pizza.  Orkla sold shares in food subsidiary Rieber & Søn in July but has not made any major divestments since the financial crisis.  Its sales slumped 14.3 per cent last year (FY 2009: NOK 56.23 billion; FY 2008: NOK 65.58 billion) pushing earnings before interest, tax, deprecation and amortisation 16.1 per cent lower to NOK 4.93 billion from NOK 5.87 billion.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'The Carlyle Group has hired Evercore Partners to seek buyers for its financially squeezed portfolio company Synagro Technologies, the largest organic waste recycler in the US, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  The news provider went on to note the buyout house is trying to limit its losses on the first investment made from its infrastructure fund.  Sources told Reuters that Evercore is sounding out other players in the target’s sector as well as private equity firms to see if Carlyle can salvage some of its investment by offloading the business.  In the event a buyer cannot be found, the company could be taken over by debt holders, these people added, asking not to be named as the talks are confidential.  Founded in 1986, Synagro provides waste capture and conversion services to municipal and industrial and wastewater facilities to customers in Sacramento, Honolulu, Baltimore and New York as well as its home city of Houston.  According to its website, the firm employs more than 800 people in 34 states and offers a range of services such as cleaning, including dredging and pumping, and transforming, which covers pelletising waste and composting.  Carlyle bought Synagro in a USD 772.00 million deal in 2007, taking on the Texan company’s debts of USD 310.00 million in the process.  Its infrastructure fund borrowed a significant amount of capital from Bank of America (as was), Citigroup and now defunct bank Lehman Brothers to finance the takeover, and Reuters noted this left it vulnerable when municipal spending on wastewater treatment was cut in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008.  Launched in 2006 with USD 1.10 billion, the fund invests in both public and private projects across segments spanning energy, transport, water and environmental services and social infrastructure, which includes telecommunications, hospitals, schools and parking facilities.

       " \"Russia's Gazprom could buy a stake in leading Portuguese oil and gas firm Galp Energia SGPS by the end of the year, a major Galp shareholder has claimed.  Americo Amorim was cited by Jornal de Negocios as saying negotiations between the two firms are progressing well and a deal will be concluded over the next three months.  The Lisbon-based group, Portugal's primary oil and gas supplier, saw its shares trade at EUR 11.64 on Thursday morning, close to the top of its 52-week range (EUR 5.82 - EUR 11.72) to give it a market value of EUR 7.21 billion.  Thomson Financial said Amorim Energia, a 33 per cent Galp stockholder controlled by Mr Amorim, was in discussions with Gazprom over allowing the Russian firm to supply Galp with gas and buy an indirect stake.  Galp's operations provide a good strategic fit with Moscow-based Gazprom, the world's biggest natural gas extractor, which does not currently have supply links with Portugal.   Its main business is in Iberia - where Gazprom is absent - while it also has operations in a number of former Portuguese colonies, such as Angola.  This week, Galp inked a deal in Venezuela which could see it cooperate with one of the world's most important oil-producing regions.   The group signed a memorandum of understanding with Petróleos de Venezuela to study the joint development of energy-sector projects and the deal could see exploration, production and oil and gas procurement alliances, with Galp again maintaining a presence in a region which is not on Gazprom's export list.  Galp posted revenues of EUR 12.609 billion in 2006 from operations in oil and gas exploration, production, refining and marketing, along with natural gas supply and distribution, and a developing power business.   It has realised impressive turnover increases since 2004 (FY 2005: EUR 11.22 billion; FY 2004: EUR 9.317 billion) after several years of sales stagnating at the EUR 6 billion mark.   Against this, net incomes have risen consistently (FY 2006: EUR 755 million; FY 2005: EUR 701 million; FY 2004: EUR 333.064 million), but with Galp's profit margin down between 2005 and 2006 (7.97 per cent to 7.45 per cent) its net profit increase became less significant.  The group's 2006 price-earning multiple was 5.16 suggesting a speedy return on Gazprom's investment; given that return on shareholder funds hit a record 46.5 per cent in the same year, and a Galp shareholding offers Gazprom the chance to make gains in new markets, the logic behind the 0ed purchase is clear.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

Following the purchase, NWS will control 8.8 per cent of the total issued share capital and about 20.4 per cent of the total issued H stock.  Beijing Capital International Airport is billed as the world’s second busiest airport in terms of passenger throughput, exceeding 80.00 million per annum.   The business operates three terminals and three runways serving as an international gateway and is a major domestic hub in the People’s Republic.  NWS said in a filed statement: “Beijing Capital International Airport is a quality infrastructure asset with substantial stature and a key correlation to the continuous growth of China’s economy.”   The company noted it expects there will be potential growth in the non-aeronautical revenues generated from retail concessions, advertising and rentals as disposable incomes begin to rise in the country.  GIC first bought into Beijing Capital International Airport in 2008 in a series of secondary market transactions.

The Sandton-headquartered manufacturer, which is also involved in logistics, warehousing and distribution, declined to reveal the price tag but noted the combined group has annual net sales of EUR 1.20 billion.  News of the possible acquisition emerged in April, with press reports at the time pegging the deal at roughly EUR 800.00 million.  kika-Leiner was founded in Austria 105 years ago by the Koch and Leiner families. Today the company is billed as one of the leading furniture retailers in Europe, with 7,500 employees and shops in 73 locations.  Of these outlets, 50 are based domestically with the remainder in Central and Eastern Europe, in countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia and Romania.   Steinhoff was founded in 1964 in Germany as a trader that sourced product in Eastern Europe and sold them in the developed countries of Western Europe.   While the company has evolved over the intervening period, it still remains focused on its original target markets and maintains an integrated supply chain incorporating the Pacific Rim and southern Africa.  Listed as Steinhoff International Holdings in Johannesburg in 1998, the retailer is now part of the JSE top 40 index and the JSE industrial 25 index.  It makes, sources and sells furniture and household goods in Europe, Africa and the Pacific Rim, as well as owning diversified businesses in southern Africa providing specialist supply chain and logistics, timber products and other raw materials.  Steinhoff operates across several continents and can be found in countries ranging from the UK and India to Australia and New Zealand.  However, the company noted that while it currently has retail activities in Europe, it does not have a footprint in Austria and a limited presence in Central and Eastern Europe – meaning kika-Leiner will be an ideal acquisition.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Hangzhou-headquartered Tian Ge claims to be the largest live social video platform in China in terms of total user spending, with a 33.9 per cent market share in 2013, compared to 23.1 per cent for its closest competitor.  Its video model enables multiple users to simultaneously stream to viewers in the same real-time room and allows people to interact and socialise with groups with similar interests, such as music, talk shows, finance and education.  As of 31st December 2013, Tian Ge offered over 910 types of virtual gifts and items for sale with a wide range of prices and effects, and average monthly virtual gifts exchanged between the users of its platform was over 5.70 billion in 2013.

While no further information was disclosed in the statement, a Shinsegae spokesperson told Reuters the financing may help bankroll a long-term strategy that includes potential acquisitions within the e-commerce space.  BRV is the technology- and consumer-focused investment arm of BlueRun Ventures, which was an early backer of electronic payment system PayPal, and targets companies based in Asia, primarily Korea, China, and Japan.  Hankyoreh reported E-Mart’s and the Shinsegae’s online divisions had an estimated KRW 150.40 billion and KRW 1,000 billion-plus, respectively, in sales last year.  The South Korean daily newspaper added the department store operator plans to concentrate on making the soon-to-be established corporation – expected to launch later this year – into a core distribution channel.  As part of these plans, Shinsegae has set out a sales target for this online business: to increase current (combined) sales of about KRW 2,000 billion to KRW 10,000 billion by 2023.   Ultimately, the end game is to create a leader in the domestic e-commerce industry, with Reuters suggesting the business aims to have enough firepower to go head-to-head with rival eBay as the top online retailer.  The combined entity will have an expanded logistics infrastructure to support an electronic shopping platform that offers same day delivery and three-hour reservations.  Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, shows the investment would be one of the largest announced or 1 financial sponsors-backed deals targeting a company in South Korea.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'FTSE 100 private equity powerhouse 3i is believed to have hired advisors ahead of a billion-euro-exit from two of its German portfolio companies, Norma Group and Motoren-Werke Mannheim (MWM).  The Financial Times first reported the possible sell-off; sources close to the situation told the newspaper that the disposal process is at a very early stage.  Investment bank Rothschild has been enlisted to prepare the initial groundwork for an initial public offering for Norma Group. It is thought the proposed listing, set for next year, values the German firm at around EUR 700.00 million.  The company, which expects to have a turnover of over EUR 430.00 million in 2010, claims to be a world leader in plastic and metal engineering joining applications.  With more than 3,400 employees worldwide, Norma operates across 60 countries and offers 35,000 plus products, ranging from cooling systems and air intake to emission controls and ancillary systems.  Last month the firm announced it has bought RG Ray, a US corporation which designs and makes heavy duty engineered clamps for use in engines, aircrafts and industrial applications.  According to the FT, 3i values Norma’s equity at almost four times the price it originally paid in 2005.  Meanwhile, in a separate move, the buyout player has brought Credit Suisse on board to organise an auction of MVM. The proposed sale could fetch about EUR 500.00 million and is expected to take place this year.  The Mannheim-headquartered gas and diesel engine manufacturer claims to be one of the world’s leading suppliers of efficient, environmentally friendly systems for producing clean energy.   Key customer segments include industrial, agriculture and mining, as well as hospitals and shopping centres, among others.  3i bought MVM, formerly known as Deutz Power Systems, in autumn 2007 from Deutz for EUR 360.00 million, which according to the FT, included around EUR 150.00 million of debt.   The powerhouse now believes the company’s equity is worth around EUR 370.00 million, twice the value of its investment, the newspaper added.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Hellman & Friedman and Fortress Investment have joined the ranks of investors looking to bid for Italian banking services provider Istituto Centrale Banche Popolari Italiane (ICBPI), Reuters reported, citing two people familiar with the matter.  According to the sources, the US private equity firm and the asset manager may team up to make an offer worth up to EUR 2.40 billion for the Milan-based group ahead of a 23rd March deadline.  In January 24 Ore Italia noted Permira was the first to make a bid for ICBPI for EUR 2.20 billion.  Two other undisclosed funds put in a EUR 1.90 billion offer around the same time and any deal would require approval from the European Central Bank and the Bank of Italy, the newspaper reported.   Later that month Reuters observed that Bain Capital and Advent International have joined the race to acquire ICBPI with a proposal of less than EUR 2.00 billion.  Yesterday the news provider cited people as saying Permira has teamed up with CVC Capital Partners, while BC Partners and Cinven have also come together to make an offer for the payment, clearing and credit card services provider.  ICBPI is believed to have given the potential buyers around four weeks to carry out due diligence if they enter into the second round of an auction.  Representatives for the companies involved either declined or were not available for comment when contacted by Reuters.  ICBPI, which is owned by a number of Italian cooperative lenders, provides services to more than 170,000 active businesses, including banks, financial institutions, insurance firms and government agencies.  Founded in 1939 and also operating in Rome, the company generated revenues of EUR 574.90 million and net profit of EUR 73.10 million in the financial year ended 31st December 2013.

       " 'Alibaba Group Holding, the technology giant which made a killing in its New York debut just four years ago, is working on a plan to list shares in its home market of China, people familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).   The e-commerce business has grown massively since its flotation in 2014, which raised USD 25.00 billion and is still the largest ever initial public offering (IPO) on record.   Alibaba is now weighing options to sell shares on the mainland in a secondary listing that could take place as soon as summer if Chinese regulations are changed to allow foreign companies in, the people noted.   Currently, the country has strict laws that do not allow overseas groups to deposit stocks directly to local investors and also rules out businesses with duel-class share structures to float.   However, as of late, Chinese authorities have been trying to attract technology firms after missing out on some large IPOs in recent years including Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent Holdings.   One option being considered is the creation of financial instruments called depositary receipts, which represent interests in shares of foreign-listed companies.  Alibaba, for example, lists American depositary shares in New York, with each representing one ordinary stock.   The company has grown significantly since its stock market debut, with shares increasing 89.0 per cent over the last year and worth more than double what they sold for in the IPO.   Alibaba was trading at USD 198.41 yesterday, which valued the group at USD 508.00 billion and makes it one of the largest technology businesses in the world.   The firm’s main operations are in China and while being a global conglomerate it has been compared to the likes of Amazon in the past due to their similar online marketplaces.   In the quarter ended 31st December 2017, Alibaba generated a 56.0 per cent increase in revenue at CNY 83.03 billion (USD 12.76 billion), on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of CNY 36.18 billion.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",

According to Israeli Company News Bites, which did not say where it got the information, the would-be buyer will assume USD 13.00 million of ITL debt as part of the purchase price.  Artillery and mortars supplier Soltam Systems and Mikal Group, the second largest non-government defence conglomerate in Israel, own the target business.  Their deadline for accepting the USD 35.00 million offer for ITL passed today, Israeli Company News Bites noted.  Shares in Petach Tikva-based ITL closed 7.4 per cent higher on the news yesterday and at their intra-day peak they had gained 17.5 per cent. Prior to this increase the stock had lost a fifth of its value in less than three months.  Founded in 1973, the group produces electro-optical products which allow day and night observation for users in the military and security forces around the world.  Typical applications include law enforcement, counter-terrorism, homeland security and crisis management.  The group operates via two distinct divisions – a unit focusing on electro-optics such as thermal imaging and a systems division which devises security and defence programmes with a broader scope.  ITL expanded its global reach several years ago with the purchase of a US-based electro-optics supplier Fraser-Volpe, which contracts to the US military.   Back in 2007 group president Eli Venezia outlined a long-term strategy of matching ITL’s established technologies with the growing needs of the US defence industry.  The firm has now established a subsidiary in Louisiana which is responsible for Fraser-Volpe, as well as making and maintaining products.  It also has a manufacturing business in India known as Alpha-ITL and two units in the domestic market, namely Na-Or and Arc-Net.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The US private equity giant announced it has already kicked off the process worth JPY 51.00 billion, and expects the three-year partnership to come to an end by late April, subject to the usual rubber stamps, of course.  Since its launch in 1973, Temp has developed into an integrated human resources provider supporting contingent labour, placement and outsourcing.  It aims to become a sector leader in Asia – posting turnover of JPY 233.20 billion in the financial year ended March 2012 – and should be well on its way to meeting this goal following the acquisition.   The Tokyo-based rival staffing suitor should ramp up annual revenue to more than JPY 320.00 billion and book earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of JPY 21.00 billion, based on combined figures for the 12 months to December 2012.  Of course, this is all dependent on a smooth sale and purchase involving Intelligence, which was established in 1989 as a leading comprehensive human resources company.  Today, the fellow Tokyo-based peer provides online and classified job advertisement services, temporary and permanent staffing, and information technology (IT) and business process outsourcing services.  It also offers public and IT system development in Japan, along with permanent placement services in China and South East Asia.  Intelligence was formerly a subsidiary of Usen and was acquired by KKR, via Metis, in July 2010 in an institutional buyout worth JPY 32.50 billion.  During the three-year partnership, the company has increased revenues by 45.0 per cent, EBITDA by 170.0 per cent and operating profit by 431.0 per cent.  According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau Van Dijk, KKR’s 2010 buyout is one of the top 50 private equity or venture capital deals by value involving a Japan-based company between 2004 and the year-to-date.  Similarly, should the sale go ahead, it would be one of the top 20 exits by value involving a Japan-based target over the same timeframe.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Shares in the Milan-based firm, which publishes the Italian Yellow Pages, were suspended after disproportionate gains, having advanced 4.9 per cent earlier in the day. It last traded at EUR 0.24 with a market cap of EUR 462.49 million.  The group was quick to deny the 0, and today said there are no ongoing negotiations regarding a sale of the company. MF did not indicate how much the 0ed buyers would be prepared to pay.  Seat Pagine Gialle was bought out of Telecom Italia by Sub Silver, an acquisition vehicle belonging to BC Partners, CVC Capital Partners, Permira Private Equity and Investitori Associati, in 2003 for EUR 3.74 billion.   MF had suggested a consortium comprising businessmen Degiovanni and Fabio Arpe, as well as some Libyan investors, are interested in buying the company.  Seat Pagine Gialle can trace its roots back to 1925 and the establishment of the northern Italy telephone directory publisher Seat; by 1964 it had a monopoly over the entire country.  It took its present form in 2003 when the business then known as Telecom Italia Media spun out its telephone directories, directory assistance and business information activities.   The group incurred a net loss of EUR 179.65 million in 2008 following bottom-line earnings of EUR 98.40 million in 2007.

Wasps confirmed the development in an announcement on its website and said Hayes has hired Baker Tilly to help carry out a sale.  Former England captain and Wasps flanker Lawrence Dallaglio, who remains on the club’s board, said a buyer would take on a team “in a healthy position in terms of the direction it is heading on and off the pitch”.  Wasps generated revenue of GBP 12.63 million during the 12 months to 30th June 2010 but has not recorded profit in records dating between 2002 and 2010.  Chris Wright, founder of the Chrysalis record label, bought it out of receivership in 2001 for GBP 5.00 million and the club went on to win the Heineken Cup twice.  In 2008 he sold his stake to Hayes, who also owns English League One football club Wycombe Wanderers, Wasps’ co-tenant at Adams Park.  Hayes, a close friend of Dallaglio, has been trying to develop a new sporting village in High Wycombe for both teams to use.   Plans for a new 17,500 capacity stadium with community leisure facilities, retail space and a hotel were in the advanced stages when Wycombe District Council withdrew its support this summer.  Wasps said a new owner “will be encouraged” to carry out the development and Hayes described Adams Park as “unsustainable as a long-term option”.  “I will work with any potential owners to develop the sporting village model we had already come up with at an alternative location,” he said.  Hayes co-founded consumer lending business loans.co.uk in 1997 and sold it eight years later to MBNA Europe.

It posted net profit of USD 60.00 million (FY 2012: USD 47.00 million), showing a net profit per share of USD 0.60 (FY 2012: USD 0.55).  Waupaca was previously known as ThyssenKrupp Waupaca before KPS acquired the company from German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp in 2012 for an undisclosed sum.  The private equity firm, which specialises in turnarounds and financial restructurings, successfully recapitalised the business to the tune of USD 200.00 million in 2013.  Hitachi Metals said the deal should help it secure a competitive advantage in the global iron casting market as Waupaca has a large-scale production capacity of 1.57 million metric tonnes per annum.  The Japanese company, which intends to make the purchase via a special purpose vehicle in the US, will also be gaining access to a customer base comprising North American tier-1 manufacturers.  Earlier this year Hitachi Metals announced it is further expanding its iron castings business by acquiring control of two metals groups in India, namely RPS Vikas Casting and Garima Vikas Metals, each of which it previously had technical and sales partnerships.  It also bought a 51.0 per cent stake in MMC Superalloy from Mitsubishi Materials for JPY 5.20 billion (USD 50.75 million).  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

According to two of the sources, a divestment could value the Makati-headquartered group at around USD 500.00 million.  CVC is working with Bank of America to test interest for its 80.0 per cent holding in SPi Global, which it acquired from Philippine Long Distance Telephone in 2013, the people noted, asking not to be identified as the information is private.  The Philippines-based telecommunications firm owns the remaining 20.0 per cent of the target.  In a text message to Bloomberg, the chairman of Philippine Long Distance Telephone said the group intends to follow CVC with any potential sale.  Manuel Pangilinan told the news provider that the firm, which is billed as the country’s largest phone company, will make a decision depending on the price and terms.  The process is still at an early stage and details, such as the valuation, may change, the sources observed.  SPi Global claims to be one of the most diversified business process outsourcing service providers in the world.  Founded in 1980, the company has around 22,000 employees across 21 locations.  News of the potential divestment was first reported by the Economic Times (ET) in January, when the publication suggested CVC brought on board Bank of America Merrill Lynch for a possible divestment worth around USD 600.00 million.  At the time, the paper cited people with knowledge of the situations as saying two other merger and acquisitions transactions are also in play.  These included Minacs, which is controlled by private equity firms CX Partners and Capital Square Partners mandating Rothschild to run a USD 450.00 million sale process, according to the ET’s sources.

The news came in response to a report from Manager Magazin, claiming Freenet is close to acquiring Debitel and might table between EUR 1.4 billion and EUR 1.5 billion for the group.   Freenet did not say how much it was willing to offer Permira, which bought Debitel almost four years ago, but it indicated that a consideration would be settled in cash and financed with debt.  If the transaction succeeds - a matter to be influenced by both companies' boards, the German antitrust authorities and Debitel's bankers - current Debitel shareholders will be retaining a 24.9 per cent stake in the Stuttgart-based mobile operator.  Permira acquired the firm from Swisscom's German holding company in June 2004 for EUR 842 million.  As part of the potential deal, Freenet would gain Talkline, the German mobile subsidiary of Denmark's TDC which Debitel bought in June.  Freenet had wanted to acquire Talkline last year, Reuters said, but it was outdone by Debitel's EUR 560 million offer.  Earlier this month, Freenet said it was spinning off its DSL broadband and portal businesses into two new subsidiaries in a bid to focus on mobile telecoms.   According to Permira's website Debitel is Europe's largest mobile service provider, and controls 40 per cent of its domestic mobile services market.

The Chinese consortium, comprising Hubei Energy, investment fund manager ACE and CNIC, has agreed to pay off debt owed to original financiers of the construction of the country’s third-largest dam.  Zeballos added Odebrecht is required to deposit half of the USD 618.00 million in a trust overseen by Peru’s Banco de la Nación as compensation for paying bribes to win government contracts between 2005 and 2014.  The Brazilian construction powerhouse has ended up at the centre of a wider scandal that has spread across Latin America as prominent politicians across the region have become the focus of allegations of corruptions.  In Peru alone, the investigation has implicated four of the country’s former presidents, who are accused of taking kickbacks on infrastructure projects, and the fallout has led to job losses and companies going bankrupt.  Odebrecht is offloading asset to pay down debt and billions in fines, not to mention to reduce the impact the bans that are in place in bidding for public contracts across Latin America.

There were 0s yesterday afternoon of the aerospace ceramic maker being bought out, the Independent said without citing sources.   Its shares closed down on Wednesday at 312.75 pence after gaining 4.75 pence in afternoon trading, though the retreat was regained this morning with the group trading at 318 pence by 8:30am to value its market capital at GBP 920.96 million.  Speculation of an approach has surrounded Crucible for years now and in August 2006 it rejected an offer at 300 pence a share; at that time it was trading at around 274 pence.   There was also talk last year of a bid from Credit Suisse's private equity arm DLJ though negotiations failed.  The firm makes materials for use in a number of different industries including the medical, aerospace, power generation, satellite communications and military sectors.  Its four distinct businesses of carbon, technical ceramics, thermal ceramics and molten metal systems operate across 90 manufacturing sites worldwide.  It has struggled to maintain sales over recent years, with revenues down from their peak of GBP 1.056 billion in 2000 to GBP 681 million last year (FY 2005: GBP 751.9 million; FY 2004: GBP 802.8 million; FY 2003: GBP 880.3 million).  Despite this difficult background, Crucible has managed to turn around its fortunes with a return to net profit in 2005 (GBP 51.9 million).   Although this was down 28.9 per cent last year to GBP 36.9 million, the position marks a distinct improvement on the three loss-making years in 2003-05 and looks particularly strong given that earnings were GBP 58.3 million in 2000 when sales peaked.  With margins most recently at their highest level in seven years (7.39 per cent) and EBIT up 68.7 per cent in 2006-07 (GBP 55 million from GBP 32.6 million), Crucible's turnaround appears even more successful.  A strong cashflow position makes the group attractive to private equity buyers, with 2005-6 seeing the firm cash positive at GBP 50.5 million, while last year net profit exceeded net debt by GBP 2.8 million.  These are strengths that have begun to be reflected in Crucible's share price, which has returned to 2000-01 levels and is up 20.3 per cent year-on-year.  The fact that Crucible, with 150 years experience in its field and listed in London since 1946, has rejected previous bids suggests it will not look at an offer which does not place considerable value on its operations.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

According to the Italian financial newspaper, KKR, Bain Capital and Carlyle are among those showing an interest in the rings-to-charm bracelet manufacturer that sparkled in its initial public offering some eight years ago.  Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, shows the 2010 listing by Pandora, which was backed by Axcel at the time, was the year’s 16th-largest by value globally.

Founded in 1982 and headquartered in Copenhagen, the Pandora brand is known for designing, making and selling hand-finished and contemporary jewellery at affordable prices.  The company’s items are sold in more than 100 countries on six continents - through more than 7,700 points of sale, including over 2,400 concept stores.

The Cagliari-based group, which specialises in dial-up and asymmetric digital subscriber line internet, finished yesterday with a market cap of EUR 443.17 million.  Its stock has plummeted 39.8 per cent over the last week, and reached a new 12-month low of EUR 0.71 at yesterday’s close.  Tiscali has been up for sale since May, but bidders including Vodafone, BT, BSkyB and Carphone Warehouse have walked away because of price disagreements.  The group is one of Europe’s leading alternative telecoms operators, with 3.2 million active users in Italy and the UK.  It generated sales of EUR 916.62 million last year after a 20.7 per cent annual increase (FY 2006: EUR 759.40 million; FY 2005: EUR 745.14 million).  Sales gains have been consistent since 2004, but the internet company has not made a net profit in its history.   Last year net loss narrowed to EUR 65.31 million from EUR 130.57 million in 2006, though a 2006 pre-tax profit of EUR 46.62 million turned into a EUR 1.32 million loss.  In response to MF’s report, Tiscali said it has not received any official communication from Soru about his shareholding being reduced.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Citing two people close to the situation, ET said the serial entrepreneur has hired investment bank JM Financial to sound out potential buyers, with private equity firms and hedge funds among those to have been approached.  He holds INR 274.60 million of shares, equating to a stake of just less than 3.8 per cent in Tata Teleservices, through Siva Industries & Holdings, SIG Event Management and Enterprises, and Goldman Dealer, according to ET, citing a recent filing by Tata with the Registrar of Companies.  The paper noted that neither Siva nor the telecoms firm responded to an email on the matter, while JM Financial declined to comment.  Tata Teleservices is part of the Tata Group’s communications business, which also comprises Tata Communications (formerly VSNL) and Tata Sky.  The New Delhi-registered business, together with its associate in Maharashtra, offers a range of telephony services encompassing mobile, wireless desktop phones, public booths and wireline data services.   It serves over 85.00 million customers in more than 450,000 towns and villages throughout the country, according to its website, and three years ago entered the global system for mobile communication (GSM) market through a joint venture with Japan’s NTT Docomo.  Siva first picked up an 8.0 per cent stake in Tata Teleservices in 2006, and later sold part of it to Docomo in 2009.  A person close to the group told ET the businessman is looking to build up his war chest for promising investments resulting from the slowdown, and recently exited Aamby Valley and Hindoostan Mills for this reason.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The Dunstable-based software retailer, which is owned by the US private equity group Cerberus, is to spend the next 18 months scouting for potential additions to its portfolio and could then hold an initial public offering.  Chief executive Steve Rowley, who joined Torex in December from Anite, the FTSE small cap telecommunications and travel software group, told the FT: “The market is very fragmented and we want to consolidate it.  “We’re committed to organic and inorganic growth and, if we come back to market, it will be as a substantially bigger company.”  On Friday the firm announced the appointment of Mandy Gradden – the former director of the FTSE 250 business and technology consultancy Detica – as executive vice president and chief financial officer.  Torex Retail provides integrated software, hardware and services to the retail, hospitality, petroleum and convenience industries.   Among its retail clients are Decathlon and Ernest Jones and its hospitality and leisure division caters for groups such as DFDS Seaways, Caffé Nero and Pizza Express.  It also counts Gulf, Jet and Martin McColl, among others, as its customers.  In the financial year ended 30th June 2008 it generated a wider pre-tax loss of GBP 46.70 million (FY 2007: GBP 2.90 million) on higher revenue of GBP 223.17 million (FY 2007: GBP 6.75 million).   Net loss grew to GBP 43.28 million from GBP 2.75 million a year earlier.  Torex Retail came under the wing of Cerberus in 2007 after it was sold for GBP 204.40 million following a management fallout and a serious fraud office (SFO) investigation.  The firm hit the headlines in 2007 when a spat between the then chairman Chris Moore and the former chief executive Neil Mitchell led to Mitchell throwing the firm to the wolves.   Mitchell, who was later sacked from his position, handed over a dossier to the SFO outlining concerns he entertained about the company accounts.  According to the FT, the SFO probe is still ongoing and charges may be brought later this year.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Citing sources, the broadcaster said KPMG, which is advising on the process, has been in touch with prospective suitors.  The people said a pre-pack administration process, which is when a company sells some or all of its assets before hiring an administrator to facilitate a divestment, is among the options being considered.  Sky News said talks with landlords are underway with a view to closing down a number of the company’s stores and that a company voluntary arrangement was discussed by KPMG at a meeting in London yesterday.  However, it is not known how many locations would be shuttered under such a plan and one person in attendance told the broadcaster that if this proposed move did not generate enough support, Paperchase would continue to look for new investors.  Sky News said potential interested parties have been informed that the retailer requires new investment in order to finance business model changes and the closure of stores which are making a loss.  None of the parties involved have commented on the report.  A sale of the company would represent an exit for private equity firm Primary Capital, which bought into the business as part of a USD 31.00 million management buy-out in July 2010.  Paperchase was previously linked with an initial public offering; in September 2016, sources told the Times that the company was planning a flotation which could be worth as much as GBP 150.00 million.

The discussions and potential proposal comes a year after previous negotiations with Companhia Energética de Minas Gerais (Cemig), Odebrecht and Andrade Gutierrez were put on ice due to disagreements over price.  At the time, the facility was valued at BRL 6.00 billion, plus a percentage linked with performance, though SPIC would need to carry out due diligence on the hydroelectric dam again.   Valor reported the current proposal values the whole of Santo Antônio Energia at roughly BRL 3.50 billion, which is relatively low, but it takes into account the current financial condition, such as debt of BRL 14.90 billion.  The balance sheet also includes a negative working capital of BRL 992.50 million and a ratio of 13.1x net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, compared to the average 2.5x in the energy generation sector.  Valor added SPIC will have to renegotiate repayment terms with Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) to gain an extension until 2040, though talks between the shareholders and the lender are currently in a deadlock.  However, the newspaper noted BNDES could agree to suspend the settlement of debt until the acquisition completes.  While Santo Antônio Energia is currently stable in the short-term after current shareholders contributed BRL 261.00 million. it is thought it could face trouble once again in November.  Cash generated from operations is being depleted by monthly interest repayments to BNDES, meaning there is not enough left to go towards energy and transmission tariffs, according to Valor.  Furnas Centrais Elétricas will not sell its 41.0 per cent equity interest and will continue to be a shareholder in spite of the capitalisation by SPIC diluting the current stake, the newspaper added.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

       " 'The leaders of Italy’s number two lender and its top investment bank met yesterday, but reiterated that their firms are not in merger talks.  For two days now there has been speculation of a tie-up between retail-focused UniCredit, the fifth-largest bank in Europe, and Mediobanca, its smaller corporate lending counterpart.  0s began after a report from Il Sole 24 Ore on 6th January, which, citing sources it did not name, claimed shareholders are weighing up a merger as a possible option.  Despite consistent rebuttals from the two groups, the paper said a project is being considered informally.  A source told Reuters that yesterday’s meeting between Mediobanca chairman Cesare Geronzi and UniCredit chief executive officer Alessandro Profumo had been scheduled for some time.  The two men believe there is no industrial basis for combining their businesses, the source said.  Share in companies have spiked since trading resumed for the start of 2009. Milan-based Mediobanca had gained 8.0 per cent by yesterday’s close and Rome’s UniCredit was 3.7 per cent higher.  In the third quarter of 2008, Mediobanca managed to maintain profits against the financial crisis, posting net earnings of EUR 309.90 million for the three months, compared to EUR 389.70 million in Q3 2007.   It made bad debt write-offs of EUR 62.30 million and had total assets of EUR 44.34 billion as at 30th September.  In line with a new three-year business plan, the firm is now engaged in the three main areas of: corporate and investment banking; investments, such as its stake in Italy’s top insurer Generali; and retail and private banking.  It is this third segment which is the focus for UniCredit, which had total assets of EUR 1,053 billion at the end of September.   The Rome-based lender is a much more valuable firm in the stock markets, with its equity worth EUR 25.63 billion to Mediobanca’s EUR 6.58 billion.  Just two months ago it sought EUR 6.60 billion of extra capital to boost its balance sheet, selling new shares and convertible bonds. It also received EUR 1.11 billion from investors in the Middle East.  Il Sole’s report suggested the merger would take place in the event of UniCredit needing a fresh cash boost.  The bank made EUR 3.42 billion in net earnings in the first nine months of 2009.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

       " \"UK media group Pearson is planning to sell its 50 per cent stake in German business newspaper Financial Times Deutschland (FT Deutschland) to publisher Spiegel-Verlag, according to a report in newspaper Handelsblatt.  Pearson launched FT Deutschland - a German language business newspaper with a fully integrated online news, analysis and data service - in partnership with Gruner + Jahr at the turn of the century. At the time it was the first national newspaper to be launched in Germany for over half a century, and the first non-English publication to bear the FT moniker.   The Financial Times Group accounted for approximately 16 per cent of Pearson's total sales in fiscal 2006, around 21 per cent of its total operating profit and the division is responsible for the 50 per cent holding in FT Deutschland.  In less than five years FT Deutschland's circulations had risen to over 100,000 copies although sales have stagnated in recent years.  Pearson's 2006 results claim that FT Deutschland's circulation outperformed the German newspaper circulation market once again and was up 2 per cent to 104,000 in 2006 and up a further 2 per cent to 105,000 in the 2007 interim results. However, basic mathematics shows that an increase from 104,000 to 105,000 is actually growth in the region of 0.96 per cent, which would put it exactly in line with the German newspaper circulation market and also the 1 per cent growth to 450,000 that the UK Financial Times newspaper allegedly saw.  As the younger generation in German reads fewer newspapers advertising revenue is on the slide, causing content to migrate online along with readers. Around 55 per cent of the population in the country, 35.7 million people over the age of 14 are now online.   This trend is reflected across Europe and Pearson's interim results at the end of July 2007 claimed ft.com subscribers had risen 12 per cent to 97,000.  Der Spiegel, which translates as The Mirror, is one of Europe's most influential weekly magazines and has a weekly circulation of 1,050,000.   It has been reported that around 5.81 million Germans read the magazine, which represent just under 9 per cent of the population aged 14 or over, making it one of the most widely circulated and frequently read magazines in Germany. In 2006, the Spiegel-Verlag's total turnover is projected to have come to EUR 332 million, representing an increase of 1.9 per cent compared with the previous year.  Our full-year 2006 financials for London-based Pearson show that the group's net income slipped by GBP 178 million to GBP 446 million as revenues crept up by just 2.39 per cent to GBP 4.236 billion. Pearson's return on shareholder funds improved from 13.08 to 13.41 as shareholders funds slipped from GBP 3.564 billion to GBP 3.476 billion.  At the end of the last financial year its net debt stood at GBP 1.126 billion with around GBP 595 million of its total debt short-term, more than double that of FY 2005.  It is not yet known whether Gruner + Jahr, which is part of the Bertelsmann Group, wishes to keep its own interest in FT Deutschland or plans to sell complete control to Spiegel.

The proposed debut, which is set to kick off within the next 18 months, comes two and a half years after the Beijing-headquartered financial institution raised CNY 1.89 billion (USD 301.07 million) in an initial public offering on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.  Proceeds from the H-share issue, comprising up to 10.50 billion stocks and an overallotment of 1.50 billion securities, will be used to shore up core capital, lift its capital adequacy ratio (CAR) and bolster its ability to guard against risks.  The China Banking Regulatory Commission is requiring mid-sized banks to meet a minimum CAR of 8.5 per cent by the end of 2013; China Everbright had a core CAR of 8.3 per cent as at 30th September 2012.  Smaller lenders have until 2018 to get their ratios in order and reach 10.5 per cent, while key institutions need to target at least 11.5 per cent.

On the same day, the Memphis Business Journal claimed DHL spokesman Jonathan Baker had been on the record to deny the speculation.  \"There is no question about our exiting the US business, a withdrawal can be completely ruled out,\" Mr Baker was quoted as saying.  Germany-based Deutsche Post established the unit in 2002 to compete with United Parcel Service and FedEx on their home turf, and DHL is now the US\\'s third-largest provider of international express mail delivery services.   On Wednesday, Deutsche Post said it would write down EUR 600 million of the value of DHL in the Americas in fiscal 2007.  Mr Baker spoke of \"industry-wide\" problems and said the decision was more based on accounting prudence than lagging sales.  \"Just like everyone else, [our problems] are a result of economic conditions that have affected the industry as a whole,\" he added, expressing Deutsche Post\\'s commitment to improving the US business.  The Bonn-based firm said it is anticipating DHL Holdings USA will generate pre-tax earnings of between EUR 900 million and EUR 1.1 billion in 2009, and maintains that it will be looking to retain a \"significant presence\" in the US.  Reuters cited ING analysts as suggesting a tie-up of the DHL express delivery unit with FedEx, coupled with a deal to offer the Memphis-based firm a joint venture in Europe to deepen its market share, might be the \"most elegant solution for the massive profitability problems of DHL in the US\".

The news comes after clients holding around 80.0 per cent of the fund asked to cash in their investments because Madrid-based Banif suspended payments in February.  According to Expansión, which did not name its sources, the sale will take place over the next two years and will not be complete before the spring of 2011.  It is understood that Banif’s manager Santander Real Estate yesterday informed clients of plans to gradually sell assets, though it will try to get maximum returns in the shortest possible timeframe.  Spanish real estate company CB Richard Ellis will handle the sale to avoid any conflicts of interest, Expansión added.  Banif is the largest property fund of its kind in Spain, according to Reuters, and the EUR 3.00 billion of assets to be sold represent 90.0 per cent of its value.  It is backed by the third largest bank in the world in terms of profits in 2008. Expansión said the global financial services heavyweight has been financing Banif’s recent acquisitions to the detriment of the fund.  Madrid-based Santander generated net income of EUR 9.35 billion in 2008 – down 3.0 per cent from EUR 9.64 billion in 2007 (FY 2006: EUR 8.25 billion; FY 2005: EUR 6.75 billion).

According to the sources, the company has appointed JPMorgan to run an auction as companies in the retail industry look for new ways of staying afloat.  The sector has struggled as of late, with a large number of businesses being sold/consolidating in a bid to keep up with online giants such as Amazon as more consumers use the Internet to shop as an alternative to brick and mortar stores.  TechStyle is based in California and manages businesses including ShoeDazzel, JustFab and Fabletics, which it launched with Hudson in 2013.

Among those is singer Rihanna who created the Fenty collection in conjunction with sporting goods retailer Puma, as well as Beyoncé’s fitness brand Ivy Park, available at high street stores TopShop and JD.  Athleisure is a growing segment as customers begin to wear workout apparel for both sport and everyday activities.   Fabletics for example, has more than 1.00 million members and over 4.00 million social media followers.  The brand is available in the US, the UK, Germany and Australia, among other locations.  TechStyle gained a billion-dollar valuation and a unicorn status in 2014 after Fabletics achieved triple-digit growth in its second year of operations, Entrepreneur magazine reported.  With around 18 stores currently in operation, earlier this year the company announced plans to open a further 12 locations across the US in 2017.

For Gas Natural, the offer represents a 3.9 per cent premium to its close of EUR 18.28 yesterday, which valued the company at roughly EUR 18.29 billion.    The deal will leave Repsol with a large amount of cash on its balance sheet which may be used to try and compete in the Spanish retail energy markets, a report by the Financial Times noted.

The firm holds a 20.0 per cent stake in Ballyroe, while 50.0 per cent is owned by operator Providence Resources and the remaining 30.0 per cent by San Leon Energy.

Katsuya Okada, the ruling Democratic Party’s secretary general, confirmed that his party is considering reducing state ownership of three significant national assets.  He told Reuters: \"The government is taking a look at a sale of Tokyo Metro shares. But it would not be enough. I believe the sale of some shares in NTT and JT [Japan Tobacco] should also be considered.\"  The state owns a third of NTT, which is the minimum amount required by law. Any share sale would therefore require changes to legislation, Reuters observed.  “My party is in the midst of discussing how much funds can be raised by selling government assets and reducing unneeded expenses,” Okada told Bloomberg.  Japan needs around JPY 13,000 billion (USD 168.57 billion) more to rebuild the country over the next five years after the devastating earthquake and tsunami.  NTT is the country’s dominant telecoms operator and a Fortune 500 company.   It generates annual revenue in excess of JPY 10,000 billion, making it one of the largest global communications companies. Last year its net income increased by 3.5 per cent to JPY 509.63 billion.  Japan could more easily sell down its share of Tokyo Metro, as it could do so without changing the law.   The USD-3.68-billion-revenue subway operator – which connects the four corners of Tokyo – has been slated for a listing since long before the Tohoku quake.   Reports now suggest a 60.0 per cent interest will be sold in an initial public offering worth JPY 115.00 billion.

The news provider added that Esther Yim, an analyst at Samsung Securities, said an acquisition by a private equity firm may cause concerns about changes to Halla’s growth strategy.  Halla was established as a joint venture between Ford Motor Company and Mondo in 1986.  In 1999 the US car manufacturer chose to spin off its component divisions and transferred the majority of its interest to Visteon.  Halla acquired its Visteon’s climate control business in March 2013 for an undisclosed amount.

Separately, a person with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg that Labelux is still trying to decide whether to launch an IPO, noting money raised would be pumped into expansion in Asia.  This source added the parent would retain a majority stake in the shoe maker following any listing.  Jimmy Choo is an iconic luxury brand embodying glamour and which today has been made famous by the character Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City.  The company has more than 150 stores in 32 countries and is present in the most prestigious department and speciality stores worldwide, according to Labelux’s website.  Along with locations in the luxury shopping destinations such as Sloane Street and Bond Street in London, it also has a presence on Avenue Montaigne in Paris, Via Condotti in Rome, Madison Avenue in New York, Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills and Ginza in Tokyo.  Jimmy Choo dates its roots to a namesake bespoke shoemaker based in East End of London in the early 1990s and who catered to the likes of Princess Diana.  It was formally founded in 1996 when Tamara Mellon realised there was a niche in the luxury shoe market for branded shoes, handbags and similar accessories.

       " 'Sateri International, a Chinese manufacturer of wood-based cellulose, is planning a USD 1.00 billion initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong, according to the Financial Times (FT).  Sources with knowledge of the matter told the paper Sateri needs expansion capital because of soaring demand for speciality cellulose and cellulosic fibre.  Its output – from factories in Brazil and China – is one of the key materials needed to make viscose staple fibre (VSF), which in turn is used to make non-woven fabrics such as baby wipes.   Cellulose can also be used to make cosmetics, paint, plastics and LCD screens. It is generated from green tree plants.  Sateri operates through Bahia Specialty Cellulose Brazil, which manages wood plantations and operates a specialty cellulose mill.  The Chinese business, Sateri Jiangxi China, operates a mill with capacity for 70,000 tonnes of cellulosic fibre. The site is currently being expanded to double its capacity.  Will Hoon, group chief executive, told the FT: \"The Brazil-China nexus forms the foundation of our business.\" He would not comment on a possible fundraising.  The group is majority owned by RGE Group, a paper-to-resources conglomerate controlled by Sukanto Tanoto, one of Indonesia’s richest men.   It is not clear whether RGE, which has assets of USD 10.00 billion and employs over 50,000 people, will sell shares in the IPO.  According to the FT, Chinese demand for VSF has more than doubled over the last two years and the country accounts for around 60.0 per cent of global consumption.  Sateri’s planned total manufacturing capacity is around 500,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of specialty cellulose and 130,000 tpa of cellulosic fibre, according to the RGE website.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Bertelsmann operates Penguin Random House as a joint venture with UK publishing and education company Pearson.

       " 'UK asset manager RAB Capital today announced it is planning to give shareholders the chance to buy stocks in a new holding company as part of a potential reorganisation plan.  The notification comes after the firm reported on 11th May that it intended to look into its options after a period of below-par trading results.  The plan which has resulted from that review involves RAB delisting from London’s Alternative Investment Market (Aim) and being bought out by a company yet to be established.  Under the terms of the proposed takeover, the newco, which is to be formed by a number of RAB directors, will offer stockholders the opportunity to either receive 10.00 pence in cash for each share held in the firm or securities in the new parent as consideration.   The price represents a premium of 23.5 per cent over yesterday’s close of 8.10 pence.   The company stated it is to apply to delist from Aim whether or not the buyout goes ahead, and stressed it cannot be certain that any offer will be made.  RAB declared that its board believes delisting gives the firm its best shot at stabilising since it will no longer have to pay certain overheads and make regulatory disclosures. It may also sell off investment management agreements for its Energy and Octane funds.  The London-based firm focuses on the natural resources, long/short equity and market neutral areas, and as at 31st December 2010 managed assets valued at around GBP 1.06 billion.  Following its reorganisation and potential agreement sale, RAB will operate special situations and credit opportunities funds, as well as global mining and resources and European strategies.  In its statement accompanying the results for fiscal 2010, the business said the year’s figures “reflect the need for a transformation”. Indeed, loss after taxation widened to GBP 19.37 million from the GBP 3.10 million recorded in FY 2009.  Nevertheless, chairman Michael Alen-Buckley, one of the directors leading the potential buyout, declared RAB “encouraged by the outlook” for a number of new funds.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " \"Irish Nationwide Building Society, which has been preparing for a sale since 2006, could see a bid from Northern Rock suitor JC Flowers, it has emerged.  Flowers is understood to have teamed with Icelandic bank Kaupthing, in which it holds around 13 per cent, in a play for one of Ireland's oldest financial institutions.  Irish Nationwide is among the country's largest building societies and provides services in savings, home loans, residential investment and property-related insurance and assurance.    The group put itself up for sale after legislation changes allowed building societies to demutualise and become public companies.   Last year, the deal was expected to fetch GBP 1.5 billion, though today's troubled markets could reduce the price.   Bank of Ireland is also understood to have expressed an interest in the Dublin building society, which was worth EUR 14.634 billion in assets last year after seeing 33 per cent growth year-on-year.  In fiscal 2006, the group increased its net profit 32 per cent to EUR 185 million, while pre-tax profits were up a similar 34 per cent to EUR 273 million.  Cited in the Irish Times, Irish Nationwide said it has neither direct nor indirect exposure to the US subprime market, but the newspaper noted that it is embroiled in a multi-million-euro loans scandal, with Brian Fitzgibbon, its head of home loans, suspended three weeks ago.  Mr Fitzgibbon is now taking legal action against the society to overrun his suspension and stop legal proceedings against him, claiming he has been made a scapegoat for over EUR 20 million in loans given to two solicitors Michael Lynn and Thomas Byrne. The High Court recently ruled in his favour.  Flowers and Kaupthing could compete with Kaupthing's Icelandic rival Landsbanki, along with Irish Life & Permanent, Netherlands-based Rabobank, Denmark's Danske and Bank of Scotland, all of which are understood to have expressed an interest.  Without citing sources, the Irish Times said this week that Landsbanki has been carrying out due diligence for some time and is regarded as the frontrunner to buy Irish Nationwide.  The duo, which took over Holland's fourth-largest bank NIBC in August, could also face LBO competition in the form of Dublin's Quinlan Private.  Flowers, Kaupthing and Landsbanki have all declined to comment on the reports.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

Furthermore, the acquisition allows the acquiror to gain access into new markets such as Australia and Canada, as well as consolidating its presence in existing regions, namely Mexico and Europe.  Christopher Paucek, chief executive of 2U, said the addition of the target is expected to enable the firm to hit its annual revenue target of USD 1.00 billion by 2021, a year earlier than planned.  The transaction will also increase the company’s university portfolio from 36 to 38 partners.  Paucek added: “Their business is a natural strategic fit and growth driver for 2U that will extend our reach across the career curriculum continuum, deepen our relationships with new and existing partners, drive marketing efficiencies, and open a more direct corporate training and enterprise sales channel for the company.”  Subject to the usual raft of closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the deal is slated to complete within the next 60 days.

Shares in Stada, Germany\\'s third-largest generics maker, were 9.5 per cent higher in Frankfurt this morning on the 0.  Neither Stada nor Teva would pass comment on the Israeli news report, which cited sources it did not identify.  Stada\\'s shares - which have lost almost a quarter of their value so far this year - finished August 14th at EUR 30.65 (USD 45.63) apiece to value its equity at EUR 1.8 billion.   The purchase would add to an aggressive acquisition record for Teva this year, with the group having announced the USD 8.96 billion purchase of US-based Barr Pharmaceuticals only a month ago.   Globes speculated that a move into Germany has long been on the cards for Teva.  Its president Shlomo Yanay told the business news service several months ago: \"Germany is the largest generics market in Europe. We\\'ve marked it, and we\\'re constantly examining possibilities there, including acquisitions.\"  Stada achieved a 26.3 per cent revenue increase last year, continuing a decade of consistent sales growth.  The group, worth EUR 1.605 billion in 2007 sales, makes generic drugs under the Lactulose Stada, Tramadol Stada and Ranitidin Stada brand names, as well as manufacturing natural herb remedies, cosmetics, chemicals and food additives.  Its pre-tax earnings reached a record EUR 196.916 million last year, tracking top-line growth to bring ten years of successive gains, but failing to keep pace with sales increases so that operating margin fell from 13.2 per cent to 12.3 per cent.  As well as a ready-made platform into the German market, the acquisition would give Teva access to a global sales infrastructure.  The purchase of Barr - Teva\\'s most expensive to date - will significantly expand the group\\'s central and eastern European presence.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Loxam has agreed to buy the Danish equipment rental assets of Finnish construction machine and apparatus rental group Cramo for around EUR 25.00 million.  In 2016, the operations generated net sales and earnings before interest, tax and amortisation of EUR 20.00 million and EUR 600,000, respectively.   The transaction is expected to have a positive cash flow effect of roughly EUR 24.00 million.  Commenting on the acquisition, chief executive of the vendor, Leif Gustafsson, noted: “The decision to divest our equipment rental in Denmark is in line with Cramo’s new strategy shape and share, which aims towards a leading position in all Cramo markets.   “In the future, we will focus our investments on the potential in our modular space offering in Denmark.”  The deal is expected to close on 31st August 2017, subject to a number of customary closing conditions.  Cramo claims to be the second-largest construction machinery and equipment rental company in Europe.  The business, which was formerly known as Rakentajain Konevuokraamo, operates in 15 countries and in 324 depots.  Cramo is listed on Nasdaq Helsinki and has 80 members of staff in Denmark within its equipment rental division, which will all be offered new employment as part of the deal.  Danish firm Loxam is billed as a frontrunning construction apparatus rental group, with more than 7,400 employees worldwide.   The company has operations across 12 European countries, including France, German, the UK, Belgium and Portugal.   According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, there have been 42 deals targeting construction, mining and forestry machinery and equipment rental and leasing firms announced worldwide since the beginning of 2017.  The most valuable of these was Sunbelt Rentals’ USD 279.00 million purchase of US firm Pride Equipment in April.

       " \"Shares in Hong Kong's PCCW rallied on Wednesday after news that the telecoms provider could be taken over.  The company saw its shares trade at HKD 5.15 - a 6.2 per cent increase on Tuesday's close of HKD 4.85 which valued it at HKD 32.856 billion (GBP 2.114 billion) in the markets.  Hong Kong investment holding company Smart Rich Energy Finance has offered HKD 6 per share for PCCW in a move which aims to keep it locally owned.   The bid places a 23.7 per cent premium on PCCW's Tuesday close and values the telecoms firm, which claims to be Hong Kong's largest communications provider, at HKD 40.646 billion.   Realising 2006 revenues of HKD 25.637 billion, PCCW provides fixed and mobile telephone services, along with offering internet and multimedia functions.   It is divided into three units: television; information and communications; and technologies services, which includes its mobile phone operations.   Television is the smallest segment for PCCW and the most likely candidate for a sell-off if Smart's offer is accepted. The business posted sales of HKD 739 million compared to the HKD 1.652 billion recorded by the information and communications segment, PCCW's largest division by sales.     The telecoms group has a strong presence in Hong Kong, which made up HKD 23.506 billion of its 2006 revenues, and with operations in China and Taiwan it offers a fit with both Smart's Hong Kong and China investments.  However, the Bermuda-incorporated bidder, which counts Hong Kong as its main region by sales, is an unlikely suitor given its loss-making financial history and the fact that it is dwarfed by PCCW.  Smart was worth HKD 187.363 million in 2006 assets and is presently valued at around HKD 1.824 billion in equity. Apparently it is planning to finance the reverse takeover with loans and an initial public offering of shares in one of its subsidiaries.  The firm was cash positive to the tune of HKD 19.574 million last year and had a gearing of 4.48 per cent (down from 49.05 per cent in 2005) putting it in a strong position for taking on debt.  However, whether Smart can effect a HKD 41 billion reverse takeover remains to be seen; it has been making net losses since the turn of the decade (FY 2006: HKD 83.193 million loss; FY 2005: HKD 71.41 million loss; FY 2004: HKD 35.713 million loss).  PCCW's chairman Richard Li increased doubts about the success of Smart's bid when he said he had not received any credible offers fpr a buyout.   © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

The West Perth-headquartered firm, which is focused on the Kambalda region of western Australia, has requested a trading halt from the Australian Securities Exchange starting from 17th December.  It failed to reveal further details regarding its proposed cash call.  Australian Mines is planning to develop into a respected and successful nickel project developer by making its operations profitable and expanding on the growth potential of its assets, according to its website.  The company aims to maximise shareholder value by acquiring, discovering and developing lucrative mining projects.  Australian Mines has been looking to develop its gold interests, which have been under underexplored for the metal while the tenements have been in the hands of nickel miners, it said in a report ended 30th September.  The group’s gold assets include the Golden Ridge projects near to the Golden Ridge mine, which historically produced 250,000 ounces.   East Location 45 contains the Mt Martin gold mine, which has historically produced 180,000 ounces of gold, and has a possible mineral resource of around 200,000 ounces.  It added its Woodline project has resources containing 12,000 ounces of gold.  Australian Mines has also retained all of its nickel assets, totalling around 28,500 tonnes, while it expands its gold operations.   The company said it will keep an eye on the price of the metal and will review options for these assets in order to maximise the return to shareholders.  In the financial year ended 30th June 2009 Australian Mines’ revenue plummeted 69.2 per cent to AUD 7.57 million (GBP 4.16 million) from AUD 24.57 million a year earlier.  The miner incurred its second consecutive annual net loss – of AUD 3.44 million, narrowed from a loss of AUD 4.48 million in FY 2007-08.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

It is a move aimed at increasing Arrow Enterprise Computing Solutions' presence in Europe, with the deal potentially giving it a presence in 24 countries.  Logix, a Courbevoie-based subsidiary of the French business information software developer Groupe Open, is responsible for the distribution of midrange servers, storage and software.  With operations in 11 European countries, as well as North Africa and the Middle East, the group makes annual gross revenues of EUR 500 million, according to Arrow.  In 2006, Logix generated EUR 150.464 million in sales after seeing 8.3 per cent growth year-on-year and its eighth consecutive year of sales increases.  The figure more than trebled to EUR 490 million in 2007, equivalent to 72.5 per cent of Group Open's revenue for the year, the parent company said.  However, despite consistent revenue growth, 2006 saw Logix post a net loss of EUR 958,000 - the first negative earnings figure of the last 10 years. Groupe Open has not yet published 2007 earnings.  Logix' bottom-line profit has been consistently declining from a peak of EUR 1.955 million in 2003 (FY 2004: EUR 1.905 million; FY 2005: EUR 33,000; FY 2006: EUR 985,000 loss). Pre-tax profit has followed a similar downward trajectory from a high of EUR 4.129 million in 2003.  Groupe Open has also seen declining earnings since the middle of the decade, though it made back some of its losses in 2006, netting EUR 3.9 million from EUR 1.5 million in 2005 (FY 2004: EUR 4.5 million; FY 2003: EUR 4.175 million; FY 2002: EUR 4.088 million).  Having previously enjoyed a strong cash position, carrying no net leverage between 1998 and 2004, Groupe Open posted a net debt of EUR 6.2 million in 2005, but reduced the figure to EUR 100,000 in 2006.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

Australia\\'s richest man James Packer controls PBL and the group is close to finalising plans to split up its media and gaming assets, a move that will give the company a AUD 2.7 billion war chest.  PBL confirmed the speculation today in a statement, which claimed PBL has \"commenced due diligence on an existing gaming business which is located outside Australia and which would be wholly-owned if it proceeds\". The company did not disclose any further information.  The split proposal by PBL will see investors receive one share in each of the two new companies as well as AUD 3 in cash for each PBL share. The two entities will be known as Consolidated Media Holdings and Crown, which will hold the company\\'s media and gaming operations respectively.  The Australian Financial Review failed to cite any sources but suggested that Crown has already held talks with the representative of the Chester Casino and Racetrack in Pennsylvania, owned by the world\\'s largest casino company Hurrah\\'s Entertainment. The publication also suggested that Crown was eyeing up a move to take the Meadows Racetrack & Casino off the hands of gaming magnate Bill Paulos and buyout group Oaktree Capital Management.  Chester operates more than 2,700 slot and video poker machines in 100,000 square feet of gaming space. Citigroup analyst Jenny Owen has estimated that it will post annual profit after tax of around USD 165 million (AUD 186.359 million).  PBL has already made around USD 1.5 billion worth of acquisition in the US and Canada this year as he attempts to distance himself from the wealth of media-based assets passed down to him from his father Kerry Packer.   Any purchase by PBL will be subject to regulatory approvals, which could take between 12 and 18 months to obtain so it seems likely that the deal will not be 1 until the end of 2008 at least.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Through a local subsidiary, the US fridges-to-water filters maker will first take over the entire 29.5 per cent stake held by Sanyo Electric and Sanyo Electric China.  It will then ramp up its investment in the branded Anhui Province-based manufacturer to 51.0 per cent by subscribing for 233.64 million shares in a private placement slated to close by the end of 2014.  Established in 1994, Hefei Sanyo has been listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since July 2004.  The company makes washing machines, fridges and microwaves under brands such as Sanyo, Rongshida /Royal Star and Diqua from three local manufacturing bases.  Major shareholders include Hefei State-owned Assets Holding with a 33.6 per cent stake and the Japanese electronics major Sanyo Electric and its affiliates.  The acquisition is expected to accelerate Whirlpool’s growth in China’s emerging market, building on the Michigan-based company’s existing strong presence in the country’s higher tier segments.

Ziv Aviram and Amnon Shashua’s latest venture develops technology – without the need for network connectivity – to help the visually impaired, blind or those with reading difficulties interact with their surroundings.  OrCam, which the two founded in 2010 while running MobilEye, has created camera-mounted eyeglass frames that can read newspapers and street signs, and uses artificial intelligence to recognise familiar faces.  The assistive technology is positioned near the ear and a computerised voice ‘speaks’ to the user about what it can ‘see’ or ‘read’, and the device can even bank notes and identify credit cards previously entered by the user.  OrCam has just raised USD 30.40 million from the likes of Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings and Meitav Dash Provident Funds, among others, via a financing round that gives the company a USD 1.00 billion valuation.  The latest equity injection brings the total investment amount so far to USD 130.40 million.  When contacted by Reuters, Aviram said: “We have sufficient reserves of money to finish our development, but part of our investment rounds is also preparing the company for the next phase, which is IPO.”  OrCam intends to tap larger, global funds for an additional USD 100.00 million in about a year before kicking off an IPO on a US exchange, according to the chief executive.

       " 'The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has given its seal of approval to a planned acquisition of food wholesaler Booker by supermarket giant Tesco.  An investigation into the deal, which was announced in January, was opened in May of this year to address concerns that a combination could adversely affect competition and could give Booker an unfair advantage with regard to purchasing groceries from suppliers at lower prices.  However, the regulator said that after an in-depth examination of the planned transaction, no concerns remain.  It noted that existing strong competition in the retail and wholesale field mean it is unlikely that prices would be pushed up and concluded there is a chance that the merger could actually increase competition in the wholesale market.  The CMA said it had been prompted to review the combination because Booker units such as Premier, Londis and Budgens compete with Tesco.  However, the fact that these retailers set their own prices and decide which products to stock was enough to convince the regulator that the deal can be unconditionally waived through.  Tesco has welcomed the approval and said a shareholder circular and prospectus will be distributed in the week beginning 5th February 2018, with respective shareholder meetings to follow in late February and early March.  The supermarket behemoth agreed to acquire Booker for GBP 3.65 billion back in late January. Completion was originally slated to take place in late 2017 or early 2018.  After the CMA announced that it intended to review the purchase, the parties requested a fast-track phase two review in June.  Booker claims to be the leading food wholesaler in the UK and has a customer base numbering 1.20 million.  The firm employs around 13,000 people.

Under terms of the agreement it is selling the assets trading under the Moov brand and Prestige Telecom, an Ivory Coast provider of information technology services to all the earmarked businesses, to soon-to-be subsidiary Maroc.  The deal includes shareholder loans and comes with a number of conditions, one of which involves Etisalat formally completing the acquisition of the 53.0 per cent stake in the Moroccan carrier from Vivendi.  Other stipulations include securing competition and regulatory approvals in all six West African countries of the affected operations.  Maroc already has subsidiaries in Gabon, Burkina Faso, Mali and Mauritania but the deal would effectively turn it into a West African sector giant.  Sanyalaksna Manibhandu, an analyst at NBAD Securities in Abu Dhabi, told Bloomberg Etisalat’s decision to house all the activities in the region within Maroc makes sense.  Manibhandu noted the company obviously believes the Moroccan carrier can manage the West African assets better out of Casablanca than it could out of the UAE.  Separately Matthew Reed, principal analyst at Informa Telecoms and Media in Dubai, told Reuters Maroc has done pretty well with its own operations in sub-Saharan Africa.

Citing people familiar with the matter, the news provider said the company is evaluating a number of potential options for the division, known as Comau, and hopes to raise between EUR 1.50 billion and EUR 2.00 billion.  A sale could be launched early in 2019 and may pique the interest of Chinese suitors, a separate person noted.  However, the sources cautioned that no final decision on the matter has been made as yet and the process remains in the early stages.  A spokesman for Fiat Chrysler declined to comment on the report.  Comau makes automated manufacturing systems and industrial robots.  Bloomberg said a sale of the unit would allow the vendor to focus on the construction and selling of cars amid pressure as a result of trade tensions, declining sales and clean-air regulations.

With the acquisition, XPO will more than triple its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation run-rate to roughly USD 545.00 million and boost revenue to about USD 8.50 billion.  It will also gain access to Europe’s largest logistics fleet network, with the potential for further acquisitions in the region, Reuters noted.   An investor consortium including Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund and Canada’s Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and Public Sector Pension Investment Board have agreed to jointly commit USD 1.26 billion to XPO, according to the sources.  In return for the cash infusion, the backers will receive 28.00 million shares, equivalent to a 21.0 per cent stake, in the logistics group priced at USD 45.00 apiece, an 8.5 per cent discount to its USD 49.16 close on 29th May, the people said.  XPO will also start marketing an issue of high-yield bonds worth USD 2.00 billion, they added.  Both the equity and debt offerings are expected to be announced later today, the people told Reuters.   Part of the cash is earmarked to fund the Norbert Dentressangle deal, with a further portion to be set aside for new acquisitions, the sources said, with one adding these purchases could be up to USD 3.75 billion in size.  The people asked not to be named ahead of a formal announcement of the capital raise, while a representative for the company declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.   XPO claims to rank as the second largest freight brokerage firm, the largest provider of last-mile logistics for heavy goods and the biggest manager of expedited shipments in North America.  Headquartered in Greenwich, the company has 201 locations and roughly 10,000 employees and serves more than 15,000 customers in the manufacturing, retail, life sciences and government sectors, to name but a few.  Aside from the Norbert Dentressangle acquisition, XPO, which was previously known as Express-1 Expedited Solutions, agreed to buy Bridge Terminal Transport Services for USD 100.00 million earlier this month.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Cardinal Health’s decision to sell its distribution business in China for USD 1.20 billion will make Shanghai Pharmaceutical Holding one of the largest agents of imported drugs by type on the mainland.  The US-listed Fortune 500 healthcare player wants to pull out of the country ahead of the introduction of a new procurement system that will be fully implemented next year.  Under the reform, drug makers’ use of distributors will be restricted to just a single company, which would directly supply healthcare facilities such as hospitals, and is expected to squeeze margins.  Meanwhile, Shanghai Pharmaceutical is benefiting from the deal by gaining control of a business billed as one of the top ten healthcare products suppliers in China.  Through the acquisition, the drug giant will expand its own network to 24 provinces, which is in line with the ultimate goal of covering 28 regions by 2020.  Wholly-owned subsidiary Shanghai Pharma Century Global is carrying out the deal for Cardinal Health L, a Malaysia-incorporated company holding all of Cardinal’s Chinese entities.  This business is divided into five major segments: pharmaceutical and medical devices distribution, hospital direct sales, speciality pharmaceuticals, and pharmacies and commercial technology.  All in all, the deal covers 14 direct sale companies and 17 distribution and operation centres, as well as a supply network spanning 322 cities and nearly 11,000 medical institutions and other downstream customers.  However, it does not include Cardinal’s remaining activities in China, including Cordis, its recently acquired patient recovery business, its medical sourcing team or other functions.  The base payment is USD 1.20 billion but after deducting amounts owed to original shareholders and paying down debt and other accounting adjustments, the final amount due will be USD 557.00 million.  Shanghai Pharmaceuticals’ company secretary, Liu Dawei, told the South China Morning Post that Cardinal’s Chinese arm was a rare acquisition target as it is the only foreign player among the top 20 in the country.  The price reflects the value; according to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, the deal is the fourth-largest acquisition of a drug or sundries wholesaler or pharmacy operator so far this calendar year.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'India’s energy minister said yesterday the government is considering selling a 9.5 per cent stake in state-owned utility NTPC, the Times of India reported.  The paper noted the country’s ministry of finance, which is responsible for divestments, has been sounding out the department’s views on a possible sale.  Times of India added that NTPC management is against the government offloading stock in the business as it would not fetch a good price given the current poor market conditions as well as fuel supply problems and the reluctance of banks to provide lending for financing projects.  However, the state remains set on offloading around 783.30 million shares, or a 9.5 per cent stake, as part of wider plans to raise INR 300.00 billion from divestitures this fiscal year, the publication said.  The NTPC sale is expected to bring in around INR 131.00 billion, a substantial chunk of this target.  Sources told the Times of India the government is considering selling the stake by means of an offer for sale (OFS) of shares on the stock market.  At present, the utility is 84.5 per cent owned by the state, which would be reduced to 75.0 per cent after the divestment.  NTPC claims to be India’s largest power group, and was established in 1975 to speed up power development in the country.   According to its website, it ranked 337th in the 2012 Forbes Global 2000 ranking of the world’s biggest companies, and with a current generating capacity of 39,174 megawatts, it plans to ramp itself up to a 128,000 megawatt business by 2032.  New Delhi-based NTPC went public in an initial public offering in 2004, and five years later the government further pared its stake through a follow-on public offering.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed as administrator to the firm which produces clutches, drive plates and transmission dampers for the motor market.  Around 237 positions have been put at risk to add to the misery in the sector, which was recently compounded by news that Nissan cut 1,200 jobs at the country’s most productive car manufacturing site in Sunderland.  David Bennett, PwC director and joint administrator, said the firm had faced a “substantial fall” in work volumes over a short period of time and “has suffered as a result of the current economic challenges facing the automotive industry”.  The receivers are now reviewing all options for the failed group and will immediately start to look for buyers for the business, which will continue trading as normal in the meantime.  “We will look to work with the company's existing management team, suppliers, employees and customers to try and ensure that a solution is found to take the business forward,” Bennett added, cited by the Press Association.   AP Driveline generated revenue of GBP 11.51 million in the financial year ended February in2007 (FY 2006: GBP 6.03 million). It made a net loss of GBP 456,000, compared with a profit of GBP 915,000 in FY 2006.  The company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reading-based Magal Engineering, a manufacturer of jacks, brakes and tyre carriers which made GBP 51.92 million in turnover FY 2007.

The Copenhagen-headquartered engineering company is snapping up MIE Enterprises and Mayer Bulk, both of which are currently focused on the domestic and South East Asian mining industries, for an undisclosed sum.  Established in 2003, MIE Enterprises bought a majority stake in Mayer Bulk in 2011 in order to increase its portfolio.  Together the two companies, which employ around 200 full time members of staff, offer construction, commissioning, maintenance and repair services.   While MIE Enterprises is involved in specialised mechanical services, Mayer Bulk designs design of mobile machines, cranes and material handling structures.  The deal comes fresh on the heels of FLSmidth acquiring Ludowici, an Australian coal centrifuge provider, for an enterprise value of about AUD 388.00 million (USD 397.43 million).  Group chief executive Jørgen Huno Rasmussen said: “Combined with our current set-up and recent acquisition of Australian Ludowici these acquisitions further accelerate the development of FLSmidth's regional customer services capabilities.”  Rasmussen added the addition of MIE Enterprises and Mayer Bulk will also provide opportunities to expand the group’s newly acquired expertise to other markets in which it is active.  With more than 13,000 employees and presence in over 50 countries, FLSmidth is focused on serving six core industries, namely coal, iron ore, fertilisers, copper, gold and cement.

Commenting on the transaction, the target’s chief executive, Bruce Wardinski, said it would serve as a catalyst for future growth, adding that TPG’s experience will be an important part of the firm’s ongoing development.  In particular, its network, resources and operational expertise will enable it to build on its existing offering.  Playa was first linked with a listing in September, when it filed to float on Nasdaq some time before the end of 2016.

Speaking to German paper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Thomas Winkelmann said discussions are underway with three aviation sector operators.  He declined to identify the interested parties, but did say they were financially reputable and large enough to secure the firm’s future.  Lufthansa subsequently confirmed it is one of those in talks over a potential purchase.  Air Berlin is planning to jettison the activities in the wake of an insolvency filing earlier this week, which was preceded by 29.0 per cent shareholder Etihad withdrawing funding for the business.  As a result, the German government intervened, with its transport ministry saying it would issue a EUR 150.00 million loan from KfW to keep the carrier’s planes on schedule for the next three months.  The state cited the busy holiday season as one factor in its decision to finance the Air Berlin’s immediate future as it did not want vacationers to be stuck abroad as a consequence of Etihad’s withdrawal.  For now the company’s existing flights and bookings remain valid and it is still possible to book future flights.  Air Berlin describes itself as one of the leading companies in the European aviation market, having carried some 29.90 million passengers to 135 destinations worldwide in 2016.  The company employs 8,481 people.  However, it has been in financial turmoil for a number of years; in 2016 it posted a consolidated loss of EUR 781.90 million, widened from EUR 446.60 million in 2015 and EUR 376.70 million in 2014.  This has not stopped Air Berlin taking to the acquisition trail itself; in May it signed on the dotted line to pick up both LGW Luftfahrtgesellschaft Walter and Walter Flugzeughandels- und Vermietungsverwaltungsgesellschaft.

News of the correction and pricing came on the heels of an announcement at 9.39 am local time today in which Sri Trang said it had scrapped the initial public offering in Singapore due to unfavourable capital market conditions and volatility.  Investors bid down the group’s Thai-listed stocks by 11.6 per cent to THB 32.50 (USD 1.05) by 4.10 pm local time today - its securities were halted from trading on 21st January pending the price fixing.  Last week Sri Trang filed a prospectus in Singapore to sell 280.00 million shares by way of an international placement and a public offer to raise funds for growth.  Plans include buying and expanding existing rubber processing facilities and pursuing strategic acquisition opportunities, including purchasing land for rubber tree plantations.  The firm, which claims to be one of the largest processors of natural rubber globally, has 189 manufacturing sites in Thailand and two in Indonesia totalling an annual production capacity of around 860,259 tonnes.

The suitor, which is making the play for the 45.0 per cent stake it does not already own through its subsidiary Delegat’s Wine Estate, has tabled an offer of NZD 1.80 per share and will provide a scrip alternative on a basis of one for one.  While OBV’s board is yet to formally release a response, it has formed a committee of independent directors to evaluate the proposal, which is at a 12.5 per cent premium to today’s closing price of NZD 1.60.  Established in 1947, Delegat's claims to be the leading New Zealand producer of super premium branded wines for the export and domestic markets, with the aim of leading the country’s wine category growth and establishing Oyster Bay as one of the world’s great alcoholic beverages.  The group’s takeover bid follows a strategic review of its OBV shareholding– an evaluation which considered the affiliate’s financial situation and its importance as a supplier of super premium quality grapes.  Oyster Bay as a brand is the leading New Zealand wine label in the UK and Ireland with sales volume growth of 18.0 per cent to 957,000 cases in the region. It is also a well-known name in Australia and other key markets in the region including Hong Kong, Singapore and the UAE.  OBV booked grape sales revenue of NZD 8.31 million in the year ended 30th June 2010 from the production of 5,652 tonnes – down from NZD 11.50 million in FY 2008-09 due to a change in the average market price of grapes.

Heineken-APB China, a Heineken and Asia Pacific Breweries (APB) joint venture, has agreed to divest its 21.4 per cent interest in the Bermuda-registered beer producer.  Chinese government-backed Kingway has seven breweries with capacity for 200,000 tonnes apiece, according to its website.  APB said the bid price gives a 72.0 per cent mark-up on the book value of its investment. The transaction will bring in SGD 76.00 million (USD 59.96 million) profit after expenses, which will be split equally between APB and Heineken.  “We believe that this is the best possible option for this asset, given the commissioning of our new brewery in Guangzhou and our current strategy to focus on the premium segment in China,” said Roland Pirmez, chief executive of APB.  The transaction is still subject to a decision from GDH, a Hong Kong investment business belonging to the Guangdong provincial government.  GDH, the controlling shareholder in Kingway, could put a stop to the sale if it exercises a pre-emption right to buy the 21.4 per cent stake on the same terms it sold them to Heineken-APB seven years ago.  APB did not give away the identity of the would-be buyer – or buyers – but its statements regarding currency exchange suggest Singapore headquarters.

Already a minority shareholder with a stake of a fifth, the Asia Pacific-focused suitor said it will pay out AUD 3.30 per share in cash in order to become a long term player in both the growth and development of the South Hemisphere metals explorer.  The offer places a premium of 29.7 per cent on the 60-day volume-weighted average price of BCI Iron’s securities and is a 4.1 per cent premium to the close of AUD 3.17 on 18th January, a day before the securities were halted from trading pending an announcement regarding what was termed as a corporate transaction.  When the suspension was lifted today, investors bid up the group’s shares by 3.5 per cent on news of the takeover to AUD 3.28 (intra-day high: AUD 3.29; intra-day low: AUD 3.25).   The deal is expected to complete in the first half of 2011 – by early May – but is subject to a number of conditions, namely on obtaining approval from the Australian Federal Treasurer, the courts and shareholders.  BCI’s key asset is a 5.0 per cent stake in the operational Nullagine joint venture, a mine which has a life of eight and a half years and a production target of 5.00 Mtpa iron ore by 2013.  The property has a resource base of 101.60 Mt iron ore with an average grade of 54.0 per cent and a reserve base of 35.6 Mt with an average grade of 57.0 per cent – with a potential to increase following additional exploration.  Jamie Gibson, chief executive of Regent, clarified one of the reasons behind the offer: “Acquiring BCI is an opportunity for Regent Pacific to establish a wholly-owned operating subsidiary in the Pilbara, one of the world’s leading iron ore regions.   “The proposed transaction is a key element in the company’s strategy to expand its footprint and increase its diversification across geographies and mineral types.”  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

With combined sales of JPY 11,417 billion (GBP 55.084 billion) based on 2007 figures, the merged group would be Japan's largest electronics manufacturer ahead of present leader Hitachi, which generated JPY 10,247 trillion in 2007 sales.  It is understood that the main shareholders in loss-making Sanyo, including Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Goldman Sachs Group and Daiwa Securities SMBC, are looking to exit.  The three groups took on JPY 300 billion of Sanyo preference shares two years ago, with the stocks translating into two-thirds of the group's total voting rights if they are transferred into common stock.   Sanyo has recorded its bottom-line earnings in red ink for four of the last five years, with losses made consistently since 2005.  In 2007 the group narrowed 2006's JPY 200.33 billion net loss to JPY 45.362 billion, but citing unidentified sources Yomiuri said Sanyo's creditors are looking for a strong buyer to help turn the business around.

       " 'Elliott Management, the USD 24.00 billion activist hedge fund founded by Paul Singer, has acquired a stake in Interpublic (IPG) and plans to push the advertising group into touting itself to potential buyers.  0s the investor has been amassing shares in IPG have abounded for weeks and the confirmation came yesterday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Elliott said it has acquired around a 6.7 per cent stake in the New York public relations powerhouse because it believes the stock is undervalued.  It noted it will now seek to “engage in a constructive dialogue” with IPG’s board over steps to “maximise shareholder value”.  Citing people familiar with the fund manager’s strategy, the Financial Times (FT) observed Elliott will want the advertising major to explore a sale to one of its rivals, such as Publicis, Omnicom, WPP, Dentsu or Havas.  IPG shares closed up 1.5 per cent at USD 20.15 at the end of trading in New York yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of just under USD 8.50 billion.  The group owns agencies including ICC Lowe, Weber Shandwick and McCann and it has some of the world’s biggest multinationals on its books, among them Coca-Cola, General Motors, Microsoft and Unilever.  It is the fourth largest global player by revenue.  Following the collapse of a planned USD 35.00 billion merger between Publicis and Omnicom earlier this year the two groups may be scouting around for opportunities to lead consolidation in the industry.  The FT observed that Elliott is betting on any potential buyer being willing to dig deep for the chance to acquire IGC, particularly given that there is scope to run the business more efficiently and improve its operating margins.  An analyst with Bernstein told the paper the most likely suitors would be smaller players looking for scale, and named Havas and Dentsu as two possibilities.  The Japanese group may be favourite, after it bought UK group Aegis for GBP 3.20 billion in 2012.  According to an analyst with Pivotal Research Group, sufficient time has now passed in order for Dentsu to consider another sizeable acquisition and it may have both the resources and the will to make a deal.  Elliott has also been flexing its activist muscle at EMC, after building up a stake worth at least USD 3.00 billion in the world’s biggest maker of storage computers.  The hedge fund is reportedly pushing for the group to spin off its publicly-traded software unit VMware and seek strategic buyers for the remaining business.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",

News of a potential divestment comes as the Israeli drug maker unveiled its fiscal results for 2016, which sent shares up 5.6 per cent to USD 34.00 after trading prices declined last week after the company announced its chief executive would step down.  Sources told Bloomberg the asset could be valued at several billion dollars, although it has not yet been made clear which brands will be included in the sale.  Plans are still at an early stage, the people noted, adding a spinoff rather than a sale is also a possibility.  However, at present Teva is focused on finding a new chief executive, one source observed, after Erez Vigodman stepped down earlier this month amid reports about a bribery investigation.  The news resulted in a 6.3 per cent decrease in the value of shares and Yitzhak Peterburg being appointed as interim chief executive as the firm continues its search for a new leader.  Sources, who asked not to be identified as the situation is still private, told Bloomberg Teva may also consider other sales of non-core assets such as its active pharmaceutical ingredients business.  The company, which picked up Allergan’s global generic drug assets for USD 38.83 billion last year, has a market capitalisation of USD 35.51 billion; however, debt stood at USD 35.80 billion as of 31st December 2016 and the group’s potential sales are part of plans to reduce obligations.

Proceeds of the IPO will be used for expansion and to establish further centres across India, according to one person, adding the issue will also involve the sale of secondary shares to enable some investors to partially exit.  A second banker told Mint that Kotak Mahindra Capital and Citibank have been chosen to manage the offering.  Neither company responded to an emailed questionnaire from Mint.   Dr Lal PathLabs was founded in 1949 by Dr SK Lal as the first pathology laboratory in Delhi and the northern India region and has become the country’s largest chain of diagnostic facilities, serving some 35,000 patients daily, according to its website.  In 2005 Westbridge Capital Partners invested INR 420.00 million for a 26.0 per cent stake in the business.  Five years later it was joined by US private equity firm TA Associates, which infused INR 1.63 billion into the company for a 16.0 per cent interest, comprising primary and secondary shares sold by Sequoia.  In 2013 Mint reported that both TA Associates and Westbridge had jointly invested USD 44.00 million into Dr Lal PathLabs for a sizeable minority interest and it is understood the two backers will be partially-exiting through the IPO.

       " 'Germany\\'s state of Lower Saxony might hike its stake in Volkswagen (VW) in line with the VW law that allows it to block important decisions regarding the future of the company, the Financial Times (FT) Deutschland said yesterday.  The state currently owns 20.3 per cent of the EUR 57 billion equity car manufacturer, which is based in Wolfsburg in the east of the Lower Saxony region.  The shareholding stands short of the typical blocking minority stake of 25 per cent, and could be increased to this level \"if necessary\", FT Deutschland quoted the Lower Saxony president Christian Wulff as saying.  The price tag on such a purchase could be well in excess of EUR 2 billion by present market prices.  VW law shields the car giant from a takeover, aiming to protect jobs in the region by giving VW\\'s home state a blocking stake to discourage potential bidders. It also gives Lower Saxony a final say in matters such as new production sites for the company.   It is a much-contested piece of legislation, opposed by the European Commission and VW\\'s largest shareholder, Porsche, but fervently supported by VW staff.  Last autumn, the European Union ruled that VW law breaks rules relating to the free flow of capital and asked for it to be amended.

They said the investor intends to divest the target’s industrial catalysts business and its performance chemicals and speciality glass materials unit via two separate transactions after initial attempts at a USD 3.00 billion sale of the whole company proved unsuccessful.  Reuters has suggested that Carlyle would rather sell the business in its entirety, but is now resigned to the fact that two smaller deals are more likely to attract suitors given a lack of interest in PQ’s glass materials activities.  According to those cited, who wish to remain anonymous, this unit put off buyers previously interested in the whole company, but the catalysts division has already piqued the interest of various players, including Umicore, BASF, WR Grace and Johnson Matthey.  They added that the performance chemicals and speciality glass materials assets are more likely to attract private equity investors, with CCMP Capital Advisors mentioned as a possible buyer.  None of the parties involved have commented on the report.  This is not the first exit of a US chemicals company by a private equity investor in 2014; according to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, there have been six such transactions in the year to date.  The most valuable of these was Albemarle’s USD 6.21 billion acquisition of New Jersey-based Rockwood Holdings, through which Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Jana Partners, among others, sold their shareholdings.  Other targets include PetroLogistics, ADF Holdings and Galata Chemicals.  PQ claims to be the leading producer of speciality inorganic performance chemicals and catalysts, as well as the largest producer of soluble silicates, worldwide.

However, no details concerning the identities of the prospective acquirors or a potential completion date have been revealed as yet.  The activities being divested include Get Juiced’s production line.  As a consequence of the recent liquidation around 20 jobs are expected to be lost, according to Herald Scotland, which quoted Johnston Carmichael as saying increased spending targeting expansion of the firm’s product range and an increase in sales led to the move.  Nevertheless, the accountant’s director of insolvency, Donald McNaught, is hopeful a deal can be reached and said the group’s established brand name and existing investment in its equipment and product development would likely attract suitors.  However, he declined to tell Herald Scotland how much the firm’s liabilities totalled, saying only that plans to finance its expansion strategy had failed by a narrow margin.  Get Juiced started life in a coffee shop in St Andrews 15 years ago and initially consisted of no more than a fruit juicer and some oranges.  It has since grown to operate two much larger machines and has relocated to Stirling, where it now labels and bottles output for delivery and sale throughout Scotland.  The company’s range comprises both pure fruit juices and smoothies in a range of flavours, including pineapple and banana, blackberry and apple, orange and lime.

Emanuel Chirico, chief executive of PVH, which claims to be one of the world’s largest retailers, said: “This transaction enables the Tommy Hilfiger business to directly operate its fastest growing market, while leveraging our well-established infrastructure in Asia, our regional leadership expertise and strong brand momentum across both our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses in the region.”  Closing is subject to regulatory approval and is slated to occur during the second quarter of 2016.

Daniel Grieder, chief executive of the global brand, said: “We are looking forward to executing a more fully integrated strategy for China that takes advantage of our current momentum in the region. This will allow us to further realise the growth opportunities that exist for the brand by offering consumers a greater breadth of Tommy Hilfiger product lines and a more elevated brand presentation.”  He added that the company plans to invest further in the expansion of the retailer through new store openings, while also reinforcing the firm’s name in the country.

The private equity firm has not been forthcoming with financial details for its portfolio company. However, BvD records suggest it was making pre-tax and net losses before the 2007 deal.

As loss-making Borders seeks cash, the paper suggested its British stationery retailing arm has gone on the block for GBP 80 million.  Speculation about Borders selling Paperchase first came from the Telegraph on May 15th in an unsourced report which claimed it had mandated JPMorgan Cazenove to conduct a strategic review.  The paper cited retail watchers to indicate Paperchase could go for GBP 50 million, though by the time the FT report was published less than a week later the price quoted had increased by 60 per cent.  The changes followed a separate Telegraph report of interest from WH Smith boss Kate Swann, who was said to be mulling a GBP 50 million bid for the London-based stationery group.   Michigan's Borders, the second-largest bookseller in the US, spent GBP 18.6 million to increase its 15 per cent Paperchase stake to 97 per cent in 2004.   The shares were acquired from Graphite Capital and Paperchase management, who retained the remaining 3 per cent shareholding.   While the Telegraph noted potential interest from music and film retailer HMV, a deal with WH Smith would see history repeated, as Paperchase came under Graphite control after it backed a management buyout from WH Smith in 1996.  Paperchase was founded 30 years ago as an art supplier in Kensington and now has more than 100 stores across Britain, including House of Fraser and Selfridges concessions.  Last year, it generated GBP 47.112 million after posting 26.4 per cent growth from GBP 37.279 million in 2006 (FY 2005: GBP 23.937 million).  Net earnings almost doubled from GBP 2.261 million to GBP 4.306 million after a similar increase in 2005-06 from GBP 1.428 million.  With pre-tax earnings up from GBP 3.266 million to GBP 6.278 million, Paperchase's operating margin widened from 8.8 per cent to 13.3 per cent in 2007 (FY 2005: 8.6 per cent).

       " 'Polish copper miner KGHM has changed tack on its stake in the mobile phone group Polkomtel and says it is now prepared to consider selling out.  Company spokesperson Przemyslaw Ziolek told Reuters that KGHM, which owns almost 25.0 per cent of Polkomtel, would make a “joint decision” with two other investors looking to exit the company.  Together with the oil firm Polski Koncern Naftowy Orlen and the utility Polskie Sieci Elektroenergetyczne, KGHM owns 75.0 per cent of Polkomtel.  It had previously opposed exiting the Warsaw-based mobile operator, which is a quarter owned by Britain’s Vodafone.  Both the KGMH grouping and the UK mobile giant upped their stakes yesterday after Denmark’s TDC 1 a long-awaited exit.  Polkomtel operates through the Plus brand name and enjoys a 14.1 million-subscriber base.  It was worth PLN 8.05 billion (GBP 1.83 billion) in revenue last year after achieving consistent sales growth since 2001.  Pre-tax earnings stood at PLN 1.70 billion to give the group an operating margin of 21.1 per cent.   Last year was the first time since 2003 that Polkomtel managed to significantly stretch its margin; it widened 2.5 points from 18.6 per cent in 2006 (FY 2005: 19.4 per cent; FY 2004: 19.8 per cent; FY 2003: 17.6 per cent).  Quoting analysts it did not name, Reuters said Vodafone is the most likely buyer of the Polish companies’ three-quarter share of Polkomtel.  The Berkshire-based group, already world’s largest mobile company by revenue, is aggressively expanding in high-growth regions.  It operates on five continents, but its only Polish business is the affiliation with Plus.

       " 'Belgian diagnostics startup Biocartis has outlined plans to list on Euronext Brussels in an attempt to try and replicate the success of recent biotechnology offerings in the US.  The initial public offering (IPO) is provisionally set to kick off later this month and is hoped will raise up to EUR 100.00 million.  Mechelen-headquartered Biocartis, which is backed by US consumer goods giant Johnson & Johnson, employs about 200 people and launched its Idylla testing system in September 2014.  The platform is aimed at providing fast and accurate diagnoses to help personalise treatment for the patient and can give results from a sample in between 40 and 150 minutes, compared to up to two weeks through traditional laboratories.  Biocartis focuses primarily on tests in oncology and infectious diseases, as these are the fastest growing and largest segment of the molecular diagnosis market, which is currently worth an estimated USD 5.00 billion and expected to grow to USD 8.00 billion by 2018.  The company said in a statement today that proceeds of the share sale would be used to develop new tests, invest in research and expand sales and marketing teams in key countries.   KBC Securities will act as global coordinator, and, together with Kempen & Co and Petercam, will also serve as joint bookrunner to the offering.  The proposed float will provide an opportunity for Biocartis’ venture capital backers, among them Advent Venture Partners, Aescap Venture Management and Hitachi Chemical, to exit their investments.  Europe’s life sciences IPO market has shown signs of a resurgence in the wake of a boom in listings in the US, where the Nasdaq biotech index has more than doubled in the past two years.  Frustrated by slow growth on this side of the Atlantic, some firms have opted to tap into the upturn in investor sentiment by floating on Wall Street.  While slow to take advantage of this upturn in investor sentiment, the pipeline of listings on this side of the Atlantic has grown in recent months.  An example of this is French cancer immunotherapies developer Cellectis, which raised USD 228.00 million through the sale of American Depository Shares on Nasdaq last week.  Cardio3, a Belgium biotech company currently quoted on Euronext, is also reportedly putting the finishing touches to plans for a dual listing on the US exchange.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",

A director of 17.6 per cent shareholder Kresna Graha Investama told the financial investment news website the initial public offering (IPO) could value the self-service technology company at as much as USD 93.50 million.  MCI is using proceeds from the sale of a fifth of its enlarged capital, which has already drawn interest from many foreign and local investors keen to become anchors, for expansion and working capital requirements.

If an IPO does go ahead then it would be Indonesia’s fifth domestic float of 2017 to date, according to the Indonesia Stock Exchange.

These people told the newspaper the trust, which is backed by the US behemoth General Electric, is targeting interested parties for between USD 500.00 million and USD 750.00 million.  One of the sources noted that Altitude Aircraft is sounding out potential cornerstone investors ahead of its market debut, on which DBS Group Holdings and Goldman Sachs Group are among the advising banks.  A person familiar with the deal told the WSJ the company is waiting for approval from Singapore’s exchange before formally launching the offering.

It is not the first time Altitude Aircraft has lain out plans to tap the Singapore exchange for cash; five years ago it was reported the company wanted to raise around USD 650.00 million in order to fund a fleet of 14 jets.   The business unit is not the only trust which has targeted a listing in the country. Stapled investment group Far East Hospitality listed last month while Reuters reported that Religare Health Trust is on the brink of launching an offering worth up to USD 400.00 million.

The Xiamen-headquartered augmented reality (AR) interactive platform operator is listing via an offshore vehicle incorporated in the Cayman Islands that will offer 4.50 million shares at USD 4.00 apiece.  Proceeds from the first-time share sale will bankroll research and development activities, including hiring more employees and continuing to invest in productions, as well as selling and marketing operations by establishing physical experience stores.   Blue Hat is a holding company formed in June 2018 and operates on the mainland through wholly-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities to offer AR interactive entertainment games and toys.  As of 31st January 2019, the group’s intellectual property portfolio comprised 161 authorised and 40 pending patents, 14 applications for patent cooperation treaty, international charters, 56 registered trademarks, 645 copyrights for art work and 25 software copyrights.

Blue Hat opened its first physical experience store in Xiamen in September 2018 and plans to open two additional stores in the city in the first half of 2019.   By 2021, the company intends to have opened or franchised over 100 locations across China to increase its on-the-ground presence and strengthen its brand recognition.

In a statement released yesterday after the stock markets closed for the day, the Ohio-based resources company revealed it has tabled a bid of CAD 17.25 per share, an offer which places a 30.5 per cent premium on the target’s closing price of CAD 13.22 on 10th January.  Not only has the approach been unanimously approved by Consolidated Thompson’s board, but its largest shareholder Wuhan Iron and Steel, which owns a 19.0 per cent stake, has also agreed to vote in favour of the process. However, while the main internal hurdles appear to have been cleared, the deal is still subject to court and regulatory green lights.  So, why would Consolidated Thompson be of interest to Cliffs? The Montreal-headquartered target is billed as one of the fastest developing iron ore producers in North America with over 580.00 million tonnes of reserves.   It manages and operates Bloom Lake, an open-pit iron ore mine, and two adjacent development properties, Lamelee and Peppler Lake. These producing operations are currently ramping to an annualised capacity rate of 8.00 million metric tonnes of iron ore concentrate, with an expansion in progress expected to double its annualised production to 16.00 million metric tonnes.  By taking over Consolidated Thompson, Cliffs, among other things, would be able to strategically build on existing operations in eastern Canada and grow into end-markets and other steel-related minerals.  According to a presentation, the target would also offer an attractive commercial relationship with established customers – which include leading Asian players such as Chinese steel producer Wuhan Iron and Steel, the commercial import/export company Worldlink Resources and SK Networks, a subsidiary of the South Korean conglomerate SK Group.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The paper noted the country’s decision to open up the sector to foreign investors has prompted supermarket groups to move in for a slice of the action.  Nilgiris’ other shareholders are the government of Singapore, which owns a 23.0 per cent stake, and the company’s founders the Mudaliar family hold the remainder.  The Economic Times added Actis had previously been in talks withother buyout houses such as Temasek and Advent over the 40.0 per cent interest, but later opted to play the waiting game in order to secure a better valuation from foreign retailers keen to get a foothold in India.  Citing a source with knowledge of the situation, the paper said the private equity firm is looking at a USD 150.00 million valuation for the portfolio company, but will make a final decision once all bids are in.  Nilgiris was established over 100 years ago and is billed as South India’s leading supermarket chain, specialising in baked and dairy products as well as the traditional staples of grains, pulses and spices.  It also offers a range of handmade preserves and chutneys which contain more than 50.0 per cent real fruit, and great emphasis is placed on selling fresh produce.  Actis first bought a controlling stake in Nilgiris when it backed a management buyout of the retailer in 2006, and later increased its shareholding.

       " \"Blackstone Group has Italian fixed-line telecoms operator Wind Telecomunicazioni in its sights two years after it lost out in a bid to take over the firm, a local media report suggests.  Italian business daily Il Sole 24 Ore said Naguib Sawiris, the Egyptian telecoms mogul who beat Blackstone to the Wind purchase, is looking to sell between 20 and 30 per cent of the company.  Citing US financial sources, the publication valued the sale at between EUR 1.5 billion and EUR 2 billion. Apparently a memorandum of understanding has already been signed.  Mr Sawiris made his original EUR 9.361 billion purchase in cooperation with American financier Wilbur Ross and private equity expert Philippe Nguyen. The deal was 1 by Weather Investments in two transactions, the latest of which was finalised last year.  Initial plans after the Weather buyout were for Rome-based Wind to continue with a long-intended listing, though market turbulence has put pay to this scheme and brought Blackstone back into the picture.  Wind is Italy's number two fixed-line operator and offers services in this segment under its Infostrada brand name.   The group would be attractive to Blackstone given the fact that it is easily divisible into three core units: the aforesaid fixed-line business; a wireless communications unit operating under the Wind name; and an ISP division which operates the Italian market-leading portal Libero.  Wind had 14.7 million mobile customers as at 31st December 2006 and 2.3 million fixed-line customers, while overall revenues had grown from EUR 4.827 billion in 2005 to EUR 5.048 billion on the back of expansion in the mobile and broadband services market.  Capitalising on these trends Wind recorded its first net profits last year, turning 2005's EUR 331 million loss into EUR 23 million earnings, and if Blackstone secures a deal, the profitable wireless business would no doubt be kept on.  The Italian mobile telephone market was valued at EUR 20.4 billion last year, with growth of 3.9 per cent predicted over 2005. In contrast, Wind said the fixed-line sector was down 6 per cent to EUR 11.2 billion.  Revenues from these two units (EUR 3.316 billion for mobile compared to EUR 1.625 for fixed-line) give further weight to the theory that Blackstone would divest the Infostrada division.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

Joint administrator Graham Frost said the firm has suffered weakened cash flow in recent months and its board has “reluctantly concluded” it does not have enough working capital to function independently.  The business, which was worth GBP 1.84 million in revenue in the year to 30th June 2009, employs three people on mainland Scotland and six in Shetland.  Frost said: “Isle of Shuna has grown successfully over the years and is well regarded by customers.”  However, the majority of its turnover had been through wholesale distribution, and this had not been profitable.”  The group’s subsidiary Demlane, which sells around 600.00 tonnes of mussels every year, has also gone into administration.  PricewaterhouseCoopers suggested there is an opportunity for an industry player to expand; the two businesses hold a quarter of the UK market for Scottish farmed mussels.  Demlane – acquired by Isle of Shuna from SI Seafarms in 2005 – was the first Scottish company to grow mussels on long lines and the first to sell them boxed and iced.  It harvests later than the July-August season kept by the parent company because Shetland’s waters are colder and the group also imports from Spain to ensure year-round supply.  Isle of Shuna has consistently recorded revenue of over GBP 1.00 million following the Demlane purchase.   However, in 2009 the figure was 2.9 per cent lower year-on-year (FY 2009: GBP 1.84 million; FY 2008: GBP 1.89 million; FY 2007: GBP 1.84 million) and pre-tax loss widened from GBP 0.90 million to GBP 1.18 million over the 12 months.

He noted there has already been interest from financial and industrial investors but there will be no fire sale: “It depends on the offers; if they are strong we will sell, otherwise no.\"  Funds raised would be used to finance expansion in Asia and North America, Kuznetsov told the Italian paper.  Severstal’s US steel assets include both integrated plants and mini-mills with a significant downstream distribution business.   The firm now wants a buyer for 100.0 per cent of Milan-based Lucchini, which was worth EUR 2.80 billion in 2008 revenue, so it can focus on higher growth regions.  Lucchini makes hot-rolled long products, railway structures and bright bars, serving the automotive, oil and gas and mechanics markets.  In 2008 its net profit slipped 35.8 per cent to EUR 96.96 million from EUR 151.07 million (FY 2006: EUR 102.78 million), with the effect of narrowing margin to 3.5 per cent from 5.4 per cent.  Given the troubles suffered by the vehicle making industry over the last 18 months it is unlikely that Lucchini enjoyed a stellar 2009. However, Kuznetsov said prospects for steel producers have improved dramatically.  \"Prices are going up and this year demand will start growing again. It is estimated steel consumption in Europe will increase by 20.0 per cent,\" Reuters cited him as saying.  Il Sole said Deutsche Bank has been hired to sell Lucchini.

Aon has already mapped out how to spend proceeds from the divestment aimed at focusing the group’s attention on, and supporting growth in, its core risk retirement and health businesses.  The London-headquartered corporation also expects to use money to pursue opportunities to address emerging client needs, similar to recent acquisitions in the cyber risk advisory and wellbeing fields.  At the beginning of January 2017, Aon took over Brazilian health and benefits administrator Admix, which has with more than 1.40 million beneficiaries across 6,700 companies of all industries and sizes.  Founded 25 years ago and located in São Paulo, the business has roughly 900 employees and issued over USD 500.00 million in premiums in 2015.  In November, Aon acquired Stroz Friedberg, a New York-based risk manager with offices across the country and in London, Zurich, Dubai and Hong Kong.  Lastly, the group will allocate part of the money raised to buy back more shares: its repurchase programme has been increased by USD 5.00 billion to a total USD 7.70 billion.  According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, this is the largest global institutional buyout either announced so far this calendar year, but it is only the beginning of February after all.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'France’s MW Brands, the company behind John West and Petit Naivre canned tuna, could be about to change hands, banking sources told Reuters.  Trilantic Capital Partners, formerly the private equity arm of collapsed US investment bank Lehman Brothers, is in talks with lenders regarding the sale of MW and has appointed UBS to arrange a transaction, these people said.  It bought MW from HJ Heinz in 2006 for EUR 425.00 million, thereby taking control of the US food company’s European tinned fish activities.  Assets include the UK’s number one canned fish brand John West, France’s leading tuna brand Petit Navire, the sardine business Hyacinthe Parmentier and the Italian tuna firm Mareblu.  Paris-based MW also produces fish for private label manufacturers.  It has operations across Europe as well as in Africa and the Indian Ocean. Production takes place in Portugal, France, Ghana and the Seychelles, while there are sales facilities in the Netherlands, Ireland, Italy and the UK.  Britain and France are MW’s leading markets by revenue, with each accounting for around 43.0 per cent of annual sales.   Representatives from Trilantic could not be reached for comment on the possible exit when contacted by Reuters.  The sources said a recapitalisation could be another option. According to Reuters, Trilantic’s 2006 buyout was backed by a EUR 315.00 million loan.  Last year MW’s revenue slumped 9.6 per cent year-on-year from EUR 490.90 million in 2008 to EUR 443.60 million – a decline attributed to the value of the pound having significantly weakened against that of the euro.  The group is restructuring to focus on premium products and said part of the sales dip was associated with this process.  Meanwhile, in January there was talk of the family owners of Spanish fish and seafood canning company Bernardo Alfageme having to convert debt owed to two savings banks into a majority shareholding in the firm.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

No value has been attached to the negotiations.  A Coruña-based Banco Pastor invested in Vilamar Gestión in November 2003 when it conducted a capital increase worth EUR 2.89 million.   The listed bank acquired its stake through investment company Sobrinos de Jose Pastor Inversiones.  Vilamar Gestión had operating revenue of EUR 102.3 million at the end of December 2006. Pre-tax profit rose by 326.3 per cent year-on-year (FY 2005: EUR 5.30 million; FY 2006: EUR 22.58 million).  Net profit jumped 331.9 per cent over the same period (FY 2005: EUR 3.41 million; FY 2006: EUR 14.74 million).

The New York-listed owner has hired bankers from advisory firm Houlihan Lokey to run an auction and has potential buyers in mind, the broadcaster added.  Sabre is prepared to lose money on the sale, according to the sources.  Lastminute was taken private in July 2005 for around GBP 600.00 million.  The group, which provides technology for the global travel and tourism industry, reportedly expects rival businesses or private equity firms to be the most likely bidders for the online hotel website.  People familiar with the matter noted a sale could be terminated if Sabre is unhappy with the terms.  The news comes after a lack of performance from Lastminute, sources told the broadcaster.  They added Sabre spent a substantial amount on marketing and advertisements to improve the company’s results, but it was not as successful as it had hoped.  Lastminute is mainly present in the UK and France and has not yet reached the European market, according to the people.  The discounted hotel website was founded in 1998 by Brent Hoberman and was incorporated in 2000 when he joined forces with Martha Lane Fox.  In a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing for Sabre’s second quarter results, the company said it was starting a review of Lastminute in the UK.  Lastminute is owned by Sabre’s subsidiary Travelocity, which was founded in 1996 as one of the first online retailers.  The UK-based business has access to over 80,000 hotel properties and around 400 airlines worldwide, along with holiday packages, car hire, theatre tickets and spa retreats.

The transaction will be conducted via the listing of a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC), which is expected to acquire medical businesses using the listing proceeds and integrate them into the group’s operations.   With over 70 laboratories and 50 diagnostic centres in Malaysia, BP Healthcare claims to be the country’s leading integrated healthcare provider.   The company also runs pharmacies and specialist clinics, as well as food and industrial testing facilities.   According to a recent report by the Sun Daily, citing BP Healthcare’s group managing director Datuk Chevy Beh, the group is planning to build a chain of hospitals by converting its specialist centres as well as making acquisitions.    Should the IPO go ahead, BP Healthcare would be the third SPAC to float on Bursa Malaysia this year.  Reach Energy, an oil and gas exploration and production company, debuted on 15th August in a MYR 750.00 million flotation, which was the second-largest listing on the local exchange after Boustead Plantations’ offering, valued at MYR 1.05 billion.   Last month, oil palm plantation operator Chemara Palmea Holdings filed a preliminary prospectus to raise up to MYR 650.00 million.

       " 'The stock market momentum in Australia seems to be picking up as another health care company, LifeHealthcare, plans to float on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) following biotech company Innate Immunotherapeutics and motion analysis devices maker dorsaVi.  Crescent Capital Partners and Macquarie Funds, owners of the medical equipment supplier, have been weighing up the option of a possible listing or trade sale for their subsidiary since 2011.   Later that year, the initial public offering (IPO) plan was abandoned due to the sluggish economic landscape Down Under.  According to national newspaper The Australian, the IPO market has improved lately due to rising stock prices, increased confidence and the release of pent-up demand after years of few flotations.  The strong debuts of Virtus Health and OzForex, former portfolio companies of private equity firms Quadrant and Carlyle, respectively, have also breathed new life into once-stalled listings in Australia.  Virtus Health, the first public in-vitro fertilisation company in the world, raised AUD 346.48 million (USD 335.20 million) and commenced trading on ASX at AUD 6.07 per share, 6.9 per cent higher than its IPO price of AUD 5.68.   Online currency transaction player OzForex even jumped 29.5 per cent from its issue price of AUD 2.00 to AUD 2.59 apiece after raising AUD 439.40 million in its stock sale.  In addition, insurance brokers Steadfast Group and iSelect pocketed AUD 333.70 million and AUD 215.34 million, respectively, from public investors.  These successful IPOs augur well for new listings Down Under; more than 40 flotations are in the pipeline to seek admission on ASX so far this year while about 33 of them have listed their shares.   Given the positive outcome, Crescent Capital has brought the option back on its agenda again. It is going to test investors’ appetite with assistance from the investment bank UBS in a deal that values LifeHealthcare at about AUD 100.00 million.

       " 'Moscow-listed, vertically integrated hydrocarbon company Bashneft is laying the groundwork for a foreign share sale before the end of next year and the London Stock Exchange is the destination of choice, sources with knowledge of the matter told Vedmosti.  Andrei Polishchuk, an analyst with Raiffaisen Bank, told the financial daily the current market and the Russian petroleum resources explorer and developer’s high dividend earnings and good financial results could help attract potential investors.  Bashneft, which is controlled by the Russian billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov through the oil and telecoms conglomerate Sistema, had a capitalisation of more than RUB 400.00 billion (GBP 7.62 billion) in Moscow yesterday.  Vitaly Kryukov of IFD Kapital told Vedmosti that with this in mind, the company is likely to launch a placing at a premium of 10.0 to 15.0 per cent but warned the oil producer will need to convince investors it can increase output to match capacity.  Bashneft had total installed refinery capacity of 24.10 million tonnes and produced 15.44 million tonnes of oil in the financial year ended 31st December 2012.  At the end of October the group confirmed 0s regarding a foreign share offering, saying it was looking into the possibility of a sale.  President Alexander Korsik noted there are no strict deadlines but doubted it would happen this year. He did not indicate whether the company had appointed bankers or had decided how much it would raise in a debut.  Meanwhile, Vedmosti suggested the Russian petroleum resources explorer and developer is seeking to list in the UK in a bid to reduce the risk of a hostile takeover.  Earlier this year there was media speculation that Bashneft had caught the eye of the country’s oil juggernaut better known as Rosneft, which subsequently denied the reports.   However, Vedmosti reported Bashneft still remains a target and noted Independent Petroleum Company, formed at the end of 2012 by former Rosneft president Eduard Khudainatov, is one such interested party and has shown a desire in snapping up the group’s assets.  Ankorinvest analyst Sergei Vakhrameyev told the publication a share sale and subsequent London listing would reduce the risk of a takeover as it would make it easier for the producer to negotiate with any potential strategic investor.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The Monterrey-headquartered subsidiary employs 1,500 people and is expected to book earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of USD 150.00 million on projected 2014 sales of USD 700.00 million.  It posted EBITDA of roughly USD 130.00 million on revenue of USD 660.00 million in 2013 while earnings before interest and tax amounted to USD 95.00 million.  Empaque has three business lines: Famosa makes beverage cans and crown and aluminium caps from three plants in Monterrey, Toluca and Ensenada; Sivesa produces glass bottles from a facility in Veracruz; and Sisa is a silica sand mine, also in Veracruz.  The deal is expected to make Crown into the second-largest drinks can producer in North America, supplying over 24.00 billion units annually to beer and soft drink customers.    On a worldwide basis, the US metal container manufacturer noted it should end up distributing over 62.00 billion units each year, representing 20.0 per cent of all beverage bottles globally.    It added the acquisition should also underpin its leading geographic footprint as faster-growing developing regions will account for over 50.0 per cent of drinks container revenue.  Sales of this product in developing markets accounted for 26.0 per cent of Crown’s total turnover, and 46.0 per cent of global beverage can revenue, in the financial year ended 31st December 2013.  The Americas segment makes aluminium drinks cans and ends and steel crowns in the US, Brazil, Canada, Colombia and Mexico and had net sales in 2013 of USD 2.30 billion and profit of USD 327.00 million.  Following the divestment, Empaque is expected to remain a key strategic supplier to Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma, which is Heineken’s wholly-owned subsidiary in Mexico, through long-term supply contracts.  The Amsterdam-headquartered brewery operator noted it should recognise a gain of EUR 300.00 million, or USD 393.90 million, following the sale.  Heineken took on Empaque as part of its acquisition of Femsa Cerveza – Fomento Económico Mexicano’s beer operations – in 2010 for EUR 4.43 billion.

Meanwhile, stockholders in Future Ventures will also receive a stake in the business on a one-for-three basis, resulting in a 30.5 per cent equity interest.  At the time of the announcement, Future Group said the move is aimed at promoting financing flexibility and reducing debt.   Future Lifestyle Fashions will hold all of the 24-plus fashion and lifestyle brands previously owned by Pantaloon Retail and Future Ventures.  Financial Express cited an earlier statement by Biyani that he expects the new entity to generate turnover of around INR 40.00 billion (USD 741.83 million) in the first year of trading, and debt totalling INR 12.26 billion will also be transferred across.  The paper also noted Future Group is creating separate businesses in order to make it easier to secure foreign direct investment (FDI).  India’s government recently increased the threshold for FDI to 100.0 per cent in the single brand retail sector.

Citing the company itself, the publication suggested that the unnamed 13 could be sold as a package or individually and generate sales of circa EUR 20 million.  The titles in question represent less than 5 per cent of the EUR 440 million revenues created by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore\\'s French unit and this is the driving factor behind the reported disposal.  The magazines are understood to be niche and low profit-making with small circulations and limited attraction to the all-important advertisers. Such a move would also tie-in with the Italian firm\\'s current strategy of focusing on its core high-advertising revenue publications.   One of Arnoldo Mondadori Editore\\'s flagship brands is women\\'s magazine Grazia and there are suggestions that the firm plans to launch the title in France.  France is Europe\\'s biggest magazine market both in terms of revenues and advertising.  Mondadori France was established around 18 months ago in September 2006 following the EUR 551 million acquisition of Emap France. This transaction made it one of the country\\'s leading magazine publishers with revenues of EUR 440 million in the year to March 31st 2006 and a market share of 12 per cent in circulation and 10 per cent in advertising.  Any interested buyers are expected to already operate in the French magazine industry as the entities up for sale are unlikely to attract the interest of investment groups.   The group\\'s main activities are book and magazine publishing, advertising, printing and direct marketing.

Oil and Natural Gas (ONGC) and Oil India are partnering with refiner and retailer Indian Oil to make the offer for the reserves, and the news provider noted this is the first time Indian energy groups have sought interests in Canada.  In January, ConocoPhillips announced it has appointed Scotia Waterous to find a buyer for six of its Alberta properties, comprising Surmont, Thornbury, Clyden, Saleski, Crow Lake and McMillan Lake.  These assets currently produce 12,000 barrels of oil per day from an estimated 30.00 billion barrels of bitumen, but further development of the reserves could eventually yield over half a million barrels, according to the Business Standard.  According to ConocoPhillips’ website, northern Alberta’s oil sands are one of the world’s largest known hydrocarbon deposits, second only to those found in Saudi Arabia.  Reuters cited an individual from ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of ONGC, as saying the company has made a bid alongside Indian Oil and Oil India, with a source from the latter adding the offer was made at the end of July.  Last month, ConocoPhillips sold its indirect 30.0 per cent interest in Russian joint venture NaryanMarNefteGaz to its partner LukOil, as part of a plan to bring higher returns to its shareholders.  Other assets being sold by the Texas-based group include its three wholly owned subsidiaries in Vietnam, which French oil business Perenco agreed to buy for USD 1.29 billion back in February.

Mediapolis is expected to be the largest entertainment venue in the Milan-Turin urban area and can be reached within one hour’s drive by 4.00 million people, within two hours by 12.00 million customers and three hours by between 18.00 and 20.00 million.  The leisure investment project is made up of five different parts, namely a theme park, a large scale specialised shopping centre, hotel and welcoming organisations, energy production plants and a commercial development.  Mediapolis first attracted attention in the middle of November when Generali Investimenti stepped up to the plate with an unsolicited but binding and fully-financed offer for the holding.  The Milan-based building contractor offered to acquire the stake for EUR 20.00 million in cash of which EUR 13.00 million would be used to settle debts.  It also proposed a second option worth EUR 30.00 million of which EUR 13.00 million would be for paring down obligations and EUR 17.00 million of unencumbered real estate assets would be transferred to Clear Leisure.

It has until 26th May to inform the market of its plan, after which time its stocks will resume. They last traded at AUD 0.59 (USD 0.62), giving a market value of AUD 56.31 million.  Hot Chili, which was valued at AUD 10.00 million when Aragon Resources agreed to buy it in October 2009, did not disclose the size and timing of the fundraising.  It sought finance from the capital markets in November 2010 when it brought in AUD 5.00 million from selling a 22.3 per cent stake in a placement to institutional investors.  This offering came eight months after Hot Chili’s ASX debut, which raised AUD 8.00 million.  The group has interests in three large, multi-commodity copper projects in Chile, which target iron oxide, copper gold and uranium (IOCGU).  It has just started maiden drilling at two of these sites – namely Productora, near the regional mining centre of Vallenar, and Los Mantos, which is south of La Serena.  Productora is Hot Chili’s flagship project. It has resource definition drilling delineating wide zones of breccia hosted copper, molybdenum, gold, uranium and cobalt mineralisation.

       " 'US-based Kosmos Energy, an oil and gas explorer focused on West Africa, has piqued the interest of energy majors keen to access its assets in Ghana, according to the Financial Times (FT).  The private equity-backed Texan firm has Ghanaian offshore oilfields valued by analysts at between USD 3.00 billion and USD 6.00 billion, the paper noted.  It is understood that Standard Chartered and Barclays are advising Kosmos and a preferred bidder could be picked by next month.  Warburg Pincus and Blackstone Capital Partners are both investors, having pumped USD 300.00 million into Kosmos in 2004 and USD 500.00 million in 2008.  Sources close to state-owned China National Offshore Oil and India’s ONGC have said they will both come to the table.  However, the FT said Ghana will likely favour a buyer able to bring expertise in developing the field rather than a cash-rich backer from China or India.  BP and Royal Dutch Shell were mentioned, but it is unclear whether they would be able to risk their gearing ratios at such a difficult time.  Kosmos’ discoveries are located in what many consider to be one of the world’s most prospective hydrocarbon provinces, though it has so far been largely overlooked by the majors concentrating on Nigeria.  The group is also exploring in Benin, Cameroon, Morocco and Nigeria.   Its Kosmos Energy Ghana unit has a 30.9 per cent working interest in the West Cape Three Points block about 95 km south-west of the port city of Takoradi, as well as an 18.0 per cent share of the deepwater Tano block in the Gulf of Guinea.   Partners in both projects include UK-based Tullow Oil, Ghana National Petroleum Corporation and Anadarko Petroleum of the US.  The Wall Street Journal said Kosmos might sell stakes in these Ghanaian fields rather than putting itself on the block.  It claimed the asking price will be USD 3.00 billion but a deal is being stalled so a development plan can be agreed between local government and the involved parties.  Ghana is politically stable, though the FT noted that if a new company enters the equation it could be the end of generous terms enjoyed by Kosmos.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

In fact, they offer “limited pull-through or cross-selling opportunities and, in some cases, their ability to pursue third-party work aggressively can be hampered by internal considerations”.  McDermott said it is now in the process of finding acquirors for the two businesses, which will be sold separately during 2019.  \"These operations continue to perform well and offer competitive differentiation on a standalone basis in their respective markets, particularly global LNG [liquid natural gas] and US petrochemicals,\" chief executive David Dickson noted.   However, the corporation will keep the fabrication yards complete facilities for offshore and onshore projects located in Altamira, Mexico; Batam Island, Indonesia; Jebel Ali, Dubai; Dammam, Saudi Arabia; and Qingdao, China.  McDermott said the two units had combined 2017 revenues of USD 1.50 billion, a backlog of USD 1.40 billion and some 5,350 employees.  The storage tank arm serves the oil and gas, power, water, wastewater and metals and mining industries by offering terminals for bulk liquids and refrigerated products and pressure spheres, among other things.  It has built over 46,000 storage structures in more than 100 countries and has plate manufacturing facilities domestically - in Houston, Texas, Clive, Iowa, and Everett, Washington – as well as in Saudi Arabia and Australia.  The US pipe fabrication division on the block comprises two business lines, the first of which provides systems with capabilities in induction blending, and develops welding techniques, computer applications for material control, production scheduling and manufacturing management.  McDermott’s alloy piping products arm is also included; it maintains and distributes commodity fittings and speciality conduit components in stainless, alloy and carbon steel for sale to third parties and for internal use.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " \"Atos Origin, the French IT services company, hopes to acquire Italian electronic payments firm SIA-SSB, according to La Tribune.  Citing several sources with knowledge of the matter, the paper said Atos is in exclusive negotiations with the Milan-based business, which claims to lead the Italian market for credit card services.  The business has been 0ed for sale for over a year and the French firm previously faced bid competition from Cinven of the UK, as well as a consortium of MasterCard and Telecom Italia.  According to La Tribune, SIA-SSB’s shareholders had hoped to fetch EUR 600.00 million – a price that deterred would-be buyers.  The business is 24.0 per cent owned by Unicredit and 26.8 per cent controlled by Intesa SanPaolo.  They have now reduced their asking price to between EUR 350.00 million and EUR 400.00 million, one of La Tribune’s sources said.  SIA-SSB generated EUR 397.13 million in revenue last year after an annual decrease of 1.5 per cent (FY 2007: EUR 403.36 million).  It was established in 2007 from the merger of Societa Interbancaria per l'Automazione and Societa per i Servizi Bancari and has a presence in over 30 countries with subsidiaries in Belgium, Hungary and South Africa.  Based on 2008 figures the business annually manages 7.20 billion payment and card transactions, involving 2.50 billion transactions on financial markets and 9.90 terabytes of data.  Atos’s chief executive Thierry Breton, who also happens to be the former finance minister, has identified expansion in the payments segment as a must for his IT services company, La Tribune suggested.  SIA-SSB had an operating margin of 8.3 per cent in 2008, though pre-tax earnings were 5.8 per cent lower year-on-year (FY 2008: EUR 32.80 million; FY 2007: EUR 34.80 million).  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Confectionary giant Nestlé is discussing a potential acquisition of Canada-based Champion Petfoods as it looks to expand away from its packaged foods operations, the Wall Street Journal reported.   The paper cited people with knowledge of the situation as saying a deal could be worth around USD 2.00 billion and would likely involve the consumer goods company taking a majority stake in the dog and cat food specialist.   If a transaction goes ahead, it would include Champion’s unbuilt 400,000 square food production plant, which was announced in 2017 and is expected to cost some USD 200.00 million to build.   The site would allow Nestlé to expand its operations within the pet food industry and its presence in Canada, enhancing its already existing activities in the market through its Purina brand.   Champion, owned by Toronto-based private equity firm Bedford Capital, sells its cat and dog foods under the Orijen and Acana monikers, with fresh meat, poultry and fish among the ingredients used to create each product.   The company has operations in some 80 countries, with both a brick and mortar and online presence.   Nestlé is considered to be one of the world’s largest food companies, with more than USD 90.00 billion in annual revenue.   Last year, its Purina pet food business accounted for roughly USD 11.20 billion of this amount and recorded a sales growth of 3.0 per cent, placing it second for the company’s most expanded segment behind coffee.   Sources close to the situation cautioned that talks to acquire Champion could still fall at the last hurdle.   However, Nestlé’s interest comes at a pivotal time as US activist investor Daniel Loeb issued a public letter to chief executive Mark Schneider earlier this week, criticising the group for not selling underperforming assets quickly enough and having a muddled strategic approach to its business plan.   The firm has been investing in markets such as pet care, bottle water and coffee following pressure from Loeb; although it is worth noting that many businesses once prized for their confectionary operations, have been expanding into other areas as consumers become more health conscious in recent years.   Pet food and care has been a popular target among large businesses for a while, with the largest announced deal in the entire food and beverage market this year being General Mills buying Blue Buffalo Pet Products for USD 8.00 billion, according to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk.   Additionally, Mars has picked up veterinary operator AniCura Holding for around EUR 2.00 billion.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Sources told the news provider that the company is currently on the lookout for a buyer after it decided to jettison the unit as part of a streamlining process and hopes to reach an agreement before this year’s summer break.  The company has appointed Deutsche Bank to advise on the potential deal, which is expected to be worth around CHF 800.00 million (EUR 710.14 million), the people noted.  However, a separate source said the pigments division’s enterprise value could be in excess of CHF 1.30 billion and total proceeds may come to between CHF 1.50 billion and CHF 1.60 billion, once additional plastics and coatings assets on the block are taken into account.  According to Reuters’ sources, private equity players are likely to be among those interested in a purchase of the unit.  The people continued by saying that information packages on the pigments segment are likely to be distributed at some point during the first quarter of this year.  None of the parties involved have made an official statement on the matter.  According to its website, Clariant’s pigments unit is a world leader in the provision of organic pigments, pigment preparations and dyes used in coatings, printing, plastics, consumer products and other special applications.  The division’s client base spans the automotive, industrial, architectural, plastics and printing sectors.  Clariant recorded operating income of CHF 496.00 million in 2017, down from CHF 512.00 million over the preceding 12 months.

TK's stocks closed the day 11.9 per cent up at DKK 56.50 (GBP 6.03), valuing its equity at DKK 1.584 billion.  The Aalborg-based real estate developer builds shopping centres and residential and commercial properties through its subsidiaries TKD Nordeuropa and Euro Mall Holding.  Icelandic investor Stoðir, which changed its name from FL Group earlier this month, focuses on acquiring assets in the property, retail and finance industries.  Stoðir's most recent acquisition was a 39 per cent stake in the prolific investor Baugur Group, which controls a significant chunk of the UK high street including fashion retailers Oasis, Coast, Whistles and Warehouse.  Without taking yesterday's gains into account, TK's shares have lost 30.3 per cent of their value since the start of June, making it vulnerable to an opportunistic bid.   The stocks hit a new 52-week low of DKK 43.60 on July 16th.  TK's earnings soared last year, with pre-tax profit up more than sevenfold from DKK 65.2 million to DKK 462 million.

The acquisition is expected to close on 22nd December 2017 and will be financed with existing funds.  Following completion, the companies will establish a strategic partnership, allowing customers to use the target’s site to order a large part of the Clas Ohlson range.  The transaction will make the buyer MatHem’s fourth largest owner and its chief executive Lotta Lyrå a new board member of the self-proclaimed biggest online food store.  Clas Ohlson was established in 1918 to sell DIY products in Sweden; it has a strong online presence and over 200 stores in Nordic countries.  The Nasdaq Stockholm-listed retailer has also expanded into Germany and the UK and has franchises in Dubai and over 4,800 employees in total.  This expansion has had mixed results; six British stores were closed in the financial year ending 30th April 2017 but further German growth is planned for 2018, when a fourth new store will be opened in Hamburg.  For the six months ending 31st October 2017, the company reported SEK 173.00 in profit after tax, up 12.3 per cent from the SEK 154.00 million posted in 2016.  Lyrå said that the transaction will make “important parts of our assortment more available to our customers via a complementing digital platform and are able to offer convenient deliveries”.

       " 'UK/Irish drug maker Shire has secured a USD 5.00 billion credit package for a planned takeover offer for New Jersey-based peer NPS Pharmaceuticals, according to a report by the Times yesterday.  Banks led by Citigroup have stumped up the financing, the newspaper said.  An initial approach to NPS by Shire has been rejected, sources told the Times. However, a London hospital doctor with connections to both companies has been acting as an intermediary, it noted.  According to an earlier report by the Financial Times’ Alphaville blog, the UK group has been working with advisers on a potential cash bid for the Nasdaq-listed company worth just over USD 4.00 billion, which works out at around USD 40.00 per share.  NPS, headquartered in Bedminster, specialises in treatments for patients with rare diseases such as hypoparathyroidism, a condition that results in decreased function of the parathyroid glands.  Its lead product is Gattex, an injectable drug that aids digestion in patients suffering from short bowel syndrome, a debilitating disorder in which the intestine is too short to absorb nutrients.  Shares in NPS, which recently celebrated the 20th anniversary of its initial public offering on Nasdaq, closed 13.4 per cent higher at USD 31.13 on 30th May.  Meanwhile, Shire has been looking to ramp up its rare diseases portfolio to diversify from its lead drug Vyvanse for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and is fresh from buying Californian drug firm Lumena Pharmaceuticals for USD 260.00 million last month.  However, the deal that acted as a catalyst for this push was its USD 4.20 billion acquisition of Viropharma, adding the Cinryze treatment for immune disorder hereditary angioedema to its product roster.  Shire has itself become the subject of speculation that it could be targeted for takeover by US rival Allergan in an attempt to fend off a hostile bid by Valeant.  The development comes amid a tidal wave of consolidation in the pharmaceutical sector, and giants including GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Merck and Bayer have all been involved in major deals in recent months.  While Pfizer’s bid for AstraZeneca ultimately failed, there is speculation the US group may renew its addresses at a later date.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Fluocaril offers oral care products to protect against cavities, while Parogencyl is focused on gum diseases, both have portfolios that are endorsed by health professionals.   Unilever said the two brands have a high reputation among dentists and strategically complement its existing oral care portfolio, with deodorants such as Dove, Rexona and Axe, as well as skincare lines including Sunsilk and Vaseline.   Closing is expected in Q2 2019 and comes days after the group purchased French derma-cosmetic brand Garancia.

This sector generated revenue of EUR 20.60 billion for the group in the year ended 31st December 2018, representing a slight decrease from EUR 20.70 billion 12 months earlier.   Beauty and personal care represent 40.4 per cent of Unilever’s total revenue of USD 50.98 billion in 2018, compared to the foods and refreshment segment (39.6 per cent) and the home care division (19.8 per cent).

In addition, Sharp plans to issue USD 1.80 billion in new shares to buy back preferred stock from banks, further highlighting its recovery while being under its current ownership.  The news comes months after reports emerged that Toshiba is looking for a higher price for its semiconductor memory business than the previously discussed deal with a Bain Capital-consortium.   Last year the two came to an agreement for the unit worth JPY 2,220 billion; however, activist hedge fund Argyle Street Management has said the operations are worth double.   Toshiba was originally making the sale to rescue itself from insolvency and a delisting, though this is no longer necessary as the group raised USD 5.40 billion from a share issue with foreign investors.  Bloomberg also reported on the firm’s financial situation, noting it was forced to repair its balance sheet after the bankruptcy of a nuclear energy subsidiary.   Toshiba’s PC operations were transferred to Toshiba Client Solutions (TCS) in 2016 as part of a wider structural reform, which not only stabilised the business but also shifted its focus to business-to-business customers.   It has been reviewing strategic options for the unit ever since, including bringing in a potential third party.   Sharp will increase the corporate value and global competitiveness of the PC division as well as continuing development, while Toshiba plans to continue providing brand licensing for products and equipment designed, manufactured and sold by TCS.

The bid, which is believed by the press to have come from the buyout group Carlyle, is a 49.8 per cent premium to Shanks’ closing price of 90.10 pence on 4th December, the last trading day before the announcement was made, and values the company at GBP 535.66 million.  This approach has prompted the firm, after conferring with its two largest investors, to call for a sweetened cash offer of 150.00 pence – a price which “would deliver an appropriate value to shareholders”.  According to the Telegraph, Carlyle has sounded out the possibility of making a play for Shanks, which claims to be Europe's largest listed independent waste management company, in the past several months.  However, the British firm, which operates domestically, in the Netherlands, Belgium and Canada, did not announce these approaches to the London Stock Exchange as it did not think they were serious enough.  The paper added Carlyle has grown increasingly frustrated about the lack of response, prompting the private equity house to test the waters with Shanks’ shareholders regarding a possible takeover offer.

For full year 2006 the businesses to be sold generated approximately USD 2.6 billion in revenues but no longer fit the company\\'s long-term strategy of focusing on business that provide a more consistent growth stream. The bursting of the US housing bubble and hasty onset of recessionary conditions in the US homebuilding market is a major factor; with fewer homes being built the segment has been left with a massive surplus of stock and revenues for the coming year are on schedule to be down by over 10 per cent.  \"We are exploring our options right now,\" Paul Dickard, an Ingersoll-Rand spokesman, said. \"We have made no secret of wanting to divest or move away from a capital-intense machinery profile.\"  Bobcat revenues dropped by about 5 per cent last year compared to 2005, due to a decline in North American markets and a drop in shipments to distributors. Overall revenues for Ingersoll totalled USD 11,409 million in 2006, an increase of 7.93 per cent over 2005\\'s USD 10,570.3 million. Group net profits were down by 1.99 per cent from USD 1,054 million to USD 1,033 million. The group has reduced its total debt from USD 3,427.6 million 2002 to USD 1,984.6 million last year and profits from the proposed sale could be used to reduce this even further.  It is understood that the Bobcat business will be placed on the market for sale with a spin-off the alternative should the asking price not be met. However, it is highly likely that private equity investors will be circling with a bid for the currently unfavourable but undervalued assets.',\n",

The newspaper said the troubled Scottish necklace-to-ring designer, manufacturer and retailer is battening down hatches to weather the storm by closing a store in Livingstone and consolidating outlets on the archipelago into one site.  However, this is all for the greater good as administrators are planning to sell off Ortak in pieces after indicating last month it seemed unlikely a buyer would come forward for the entire business.  This seems to have done the trick, as when asked by the Herald yesterday, James Stephen of BDO confirmed discussions are currently under way with a number of interested parties.  Some would-be Scottish buyers have taken a look at Ortak but is seems unlikely management would take part in any auction.  Stephen told the newspaper: \"We are speaking to people with a variety of different interests. We have people interested in the manufacturing, the brand and certain stores.   “People interested in the brand and manufacturing without stores and we have got people interested in taking on some of the stores, presumably to do something different other than Ortak.\"  All that remains now is attract real offers and Stephen told the Herald he will spend the next week or so sounding out firm intentions and whether any of these bids would be acceptable to the administrators.  \"It is possible we might look at closing dates for certain aspects depending on the level of interest but really at the moment it is just ongoing discussions to firm up what people are genuinely interested in,\" he added.  Founded by Malcolm Gray, Ortak ran afoul of difficult trading conditions and has been in administration since March 2013.

Anderson is now required by law to make a full takeover offer for the remaining 51.0 per cent at no less than EUR 0.31 per unit.

An unsourced report from Insurance Times said the car insurance and breakdown cover provider is being separated from the rest of the group through changes to its management.  After taking RAC private in 2005 for GBP 1.10 billion, Aviva is now creating new management roles at RAC “so it is a standalone business well-positioned for a sale”, the publication said.  Changes include a new role created for former Aviva UK Life distribution director Angela Seymour-Jackson, who became RAC’s managing director at the end of last year.  Other appointments are chief financial officer and sales and marketing director – both of which will be filled by Aviva executives.  Insurance Times speculated that RAC needs to be an independent business so it can be sold when “market conditions are right”.  It is certainly no secret that Aviva is concentrating on core activities.  Cited by Reuters at a conference call earlier this month, chief executive Andrew Moss said his company has 12 key, profitable regions and will be divesting operations to concentrate on them.  He spoke of “de-emphasising certain other markets” and said a plan would “become clear” over the next 12 months.  In November the pensions and investments group sold a 69.6 per cent stake in vehicle rental business Northgate. At the time the stock had a market value of GBP 216.78 million.

It added: “In fact, we clarified our aforesaid position to the newspaper on 6th May 2014 in response to their query.”  The report in question was published yesterday by the Wall Street Journal's Indian affiliate Livemint, which said Teva is in the middle of preparing its third attempt to acquire Cipla after tabling two failed approaches in the last two years.   A banker with knowledge of the matter told the newspaper the Israeli generic and proprietary drug maker made an attractive offer at the end of 2013 as it seeks to gain access to an extensive manufacturing base in the country.  While the Indian company continues to deny all knowledge of the approaches, it may end up having to accept the takeover proposal in a bid to overcome “growth challenges and succession issues”, according to this person.  “Teva always prefers to buy a controlling stake in a targeted company, and will potentially buy the entire 36.8 per cent promoter stake in Cipla,” the banker said.  This person added the acquisition would be in addition to making a “mandatory open offer to pick up another 20.0 per cent stake from the public, at a premium of at least 20.0 per cent on the existing market value”.  Separately, a consultant told Livemint the banker’s suggested USD 6.00 billion-price tag, which includes a premium, is high as Teva believes Cipla is an ideal strategic fit, hence the approaches in the past.  Not only would the company provide access to the world’s cheapest location for producing generic medication, but it also comes with a strong emerging markets presence, including India.  This source added Teva is also drawn to Cipla’s strong footprint in the global respiratory drugs sector, a segment which could potentially generate revenue of USD 2.40 billion in fiscal 2015.  An industry analyst with a foreign brokerage told Livemint the Israeli suitor is missing the key formulation manufacturing base in India, despite having a research centre for active pharmaceutical ingredients and an over the country medicine facility in the country.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

Specialising in pension schemes and health insurance, the group also works in the bancassurance market in addition to offering banking, asset management and merchant banking services.  Consolidation would make sense for the two firms, and has become a trend in the increasingly competitive sector in which they operate.   Last year, Unipol was looking to boost its banking operations with the purchase of mid-sized lender Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, though it was beaten to the deal by BNP Paribas.   The Bologna insurer has grown its operations considerably over recent years with the acquisition of Winterthur Italia, Carinord, Noricum Vita and MMI Group since 2003.  BPM has similar sized operations, with total 2006 assets of EUR 40.181 billion to net incomes of EUR 403.9 million and market capital of EUR 4.399 billion.   It was Italy's first cooperative bank and serves mainly the northern and central regions of the country with retail banking, security broking, fund management, life insurance and investment activities.

The news of the two sales came as Axiall announced its fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 earnings yesterday.  In the twelve months ended 31st December 2015, the group generated net sales of USD 3.36 billion, an 11.8 per cent decrease on USD 3.81 billion in FY 2014.  Axiall posted a net loss of USD 816.40 million for the period, compared to a profit of USD 46.30 million in FY 2014.  The company, which appointed RBC Capital Markets to advise on the sale of its windows and doors unit, is also including the division’s manufacturing facility in the deal.  Chief executive Tim Mann said: “As we refine our portfolio, we are pleased to have reached an agreement to sell our window and door profiles business to OpenGate Capital.  “This is our fourth divestiture of non-core assets since April 2015, which allows us to better focus on our core chlorovinyls and derivatives.   “In particular, selling this business leaves Royal Building Products with the solid core product lines that generate better EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation] margins, namely our siding, trim, moulding, fittings and pipe businesses.”  Mann said something similar when commenting on the sale of Solucor, while Vishal Goenka, director of Galata Chemicals’ parent company, noted the addition of the firm is another key step in the buyer’s growth strategy as it continues to pursue additional acquisitions.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The people, who declined to be identified as the process is still confidential, said Lazard is advising the Connecticut-based manufacturer of additives for the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) industry on the sale, which could be valued at USD 150.00 million, including debt.  While the sources indicated negotiations are at an advanced stage, none of the parties named within the article would confirm the news when contacted by Bloomberg.  Galata as it is today was formed in May 2010 when Chemtura sold its PVC additives business to Aterian Investment Partners and Artek Surfin Chemicals, an Indian, family-owned metal finishing company.  Today, the business claims to be one of the world’s leading producers and marketers of additives under brand names such as Mark, Weston, Fomrez and Blendex.  It also makes and offers a new high performance candle wax component, derived from locally produced vegetable oil, and which should reduce soot and smoke formation, thereby improving indoor air quality.  The item is flaunted as an alternative to supply-limited petroleum-based paraffin and performance-constrained conventional natural waxes.  Bloomberg noted that Galata would help Oyak’s mission to broaden its client base in order to better compete with Baerlocher.  The German additive supplier announced in October it has started constructing a new manufacturing facility in Akhisar in the district of the Turkish province of Manisa as part of plans to ramp up its presence in the local PVC market.

Maybank has already kicked off a bookbuilding process to determine the price and the final number of stocks – currently proposed at 300.00 million – to be issued.  While the fundraiser will support growth objectives, it should also help the lender meet Basel III rules, the global framework requirements for banks to shore up capital and create liquidity cushions.  Under the guidelines, to be implemented in stages from 2013 through 2015, Malaysian banks' consolidated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is required to be between 8.0 and 11.0 per cent.  Incorporated in 1960, Maybank has a network of over 2,100 offices in 17 countries worldwide and is the largest company by market capitalisation on Bursa Malaysia, according to its website.  The group offers commercial and investment banking, stock broking, insurance and takaful and asset management, among others.  It is placed 366th in Forbes Global 2000 List for 2012 behind Canadian oil and equipment services provider TransCanada and ahead of the Spanish construction firm Grupo ACS.

The bid represents an increase of 24.0 per cent over the target’s closing price on 20th June, the last trading day before the deal was initiated, and a premium of 2.6 per cent on 2nd October, before the transaction was announced.  Access Industries originally planned to buy Clal via a special purpose vehicle and was subject to a binding agreement within two months from the report made by the target.   During the four months the concern’s shares rose by 4.3 per cent, from ILS 14.98 on 23rd June to ILS 15.63.   In July last year Access Industries bought an initial 49.9 per cent stake in Clal from Israeli insurance group IDB Development, for a value of ILS 1.27 billion.   The target is a publicly-traded Tel Aviv-based firm and claims to be one of Israel’s leading holding companies.   Clal has stakes in several firms operating in various sectors include basic manufacturing, advanced technology and biotechnology.

The paper added that executives from the Tokyo-based manufacturer had recently visited Hynix to discuss a potential offer, in which the two companies would each take half of Elpida and thereby secure a ready supply of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips.  The move is not entirely unexpected, as last week Bloomberg cited a senior executive at Toshiba as saying it was considering bidding either alone or as part of a group.  The source added that they were not interested in all of the target’s assets.  Toshiba had been considered the favourite to buy Elpida, when 0s of a possible takeover first emerged at the start of the year.    The DRAM maker was placed into bankruptcy protection in February, opening the way for potential suitors, including rivals Micron Technology and Samsung Electronics, to make a play for the company.  Elpida has been hit by falling chip prices and a stronger yen, which has weakened its financial position and led to the business amassing debt of USD 5.60 billion.  The first round of bidding for the ailing manufacturer closed on 30th March, and a second is due to kick off this month.  According to Nikkei, rival chipmaker Micron had offered at least JPY 150.00 billion (USD 1.83 billion) for the business.  Meanwhile, Hynix is the only company to have confirmed its preliminary bid for Elpida, and will decide whether to make a final offer once due diligence has been 1.

One of the sources, who declined to be identified as the process is still private, told Reuters the multi-billon riyal valuation is based on 20 times earnings and noted Kudu is expected to book net profit of SAR 100.00 million this year.  All the mooted bidders declined to make a statement when contacted by the news provider while the chain could not be reached for comment.  Kudu was founded over 25 years ago and has since expanded to more than 200 outlets across the Middle East, selling fast food ranging from burgers and fries to tiramisu and chocolate cake, according to its website.  The news emerged in June, when sources told Reuters that strategic differences between four individual shareholders triggered the sale of a majority stake.  According to these people, HSBC Banking is arranging the deal and has already sounded out interest from more than 40 parties, including KKR and other investors.  Kudu was touted to Carlyle, which acquired 42.0 per cent of Dominos and Wendy’s operator Alamar Foods in 2011, but the private equity house has decided it will not participate in the auction.

AZ directors, under advice from Rothschild, consider the offer to be fair and reasonable and are recommending it to shareholders.  Karl Ludwig-Kley, chairman and chief executive of the German group, commented: \"With this strategic move we are strengthening the portfolio of Merck by adding a premium business to our existing business of high-margin specialty chemicals.  He went on to add: “The combination will enable Merck to access additional growth areas in the electronics industry to benefit even better from the increasing demand for electronic devices beyond displays.”  London-listed AZ makes speciality chemicals which are divided into two divisions, integrated circuits and optronics, and used in next-generation devices such as smartphones and iPads, where they feature in the display and memory.  It counts big names like Samsung, Sony and Toshiba, along with Apple, as clients.  Earlier this year AZ issued a profit warning ahead of the release of its half-year results, which it attributed to weakness in its integrated circuits division with lower than expected sales and what it termed “an unfavourable product mix”.  The unwelcome news sent shares down 28.7 per cent and cancelled out a rally in its stock price the previous summer.

Along with the Chinese ad agency G4 Advertising it has also bought São Paulo-based digital marketer AG2 Desing in recent weeks.  Publicis did not disclose how much it paid for these two assets but the FT speculated it might invest BRL 350.00 million (USD 197.41 million) into Talent.  The São Paulo-based target has a client list that includes Timberland, Sony Ericsson, Cargill and Santander.   However, the investment would not just bring ready access to an impressive client list in a fast-growing market; it would also give Publicis access to Talent’s staff.  Nizan Guanaes, chairman of fellow Brazilian agency Grupo ABC de Comunicação, told the FT that Talent’s founder and president Julio Ribeiro is one of the country’s most gifted advertisers and described his agency as a good brand.  Brazil is particularly attractive to advertisers given that it will host the football World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic Games two years later.

He added that Atlantia may decide to push back the deadline for non-binding offers, which is currently set for the end of the month but could be postponed until mid-December.  The infrastructure player is aiming to sell 15.0 per cent of Autostrade per l’Italia in a bid to finance its international expansion.  Reports of a sale emerged in March, when Reuters cited Atlantia chief executive Giovanni Castellucci, speaking at an analyst conference, as saying a divestment was on the cards as the firm sought to grow its aviation unit to gain access to the global economy.

According to documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2009, Shenzhen-based Trony is one of the world's leading thin film solar product and services providers, as measured by production output in 2008.  The company operates in the rapidly growing renewable market, offering more than 20 varieties of photovoltaic (PV) modules used in off-grid applications including solar home systems, consumer products and street and lawn lamps.  As such, it is unsurprising that it has to compete with a raft of manufacturers ranging from Suntech Power Holdings and Trina Solar to Yingli Green Energy Holding and the PV product division of Sharp.  At the time Trony was planning to list in the US, the company expected to use proceeds to ramp up manufacturing facilities and lines as well as to pay down debt – though money was also to be siphoned off for general business purposes.

       " 'The Indian government has approved the privatisation of a 10.0 per cent stake in New Delhi-based Engineers India in a follow-on public offering to increase its free float to meet mandatory requirements.  The cabinet committee on economic affairs, chaired by prime minister Manmohan Singh, has given the green light to a placement that will only involve state-owned shares and will reduce India’s participation in the 45-year-old business to 80.4 per cent.  Engineers started out building oil refineries but now undertakes a wide range of civil engineering projects, including airports, roads and water plants.  The Economic Times (ET) observed that the current public stake in Engineers – some 9.6 per cent – is less than the mandatory 10.0 per cent.  Shares in the company rocketed on news of a state disinvestment and were 20.0 per cent higher at 3:59 pm in Mumbai today, reaching INR 2,082.80 (GBP 27.99) to value a 10.0 per cent stake at INR 116.97 billion.  The gains smashed through the top end of a 52-week range of INR 405.45 to INR 1,589.80 and the ET recorded an all-time high for Engineers on the National Stock Exchange.  Prior to today, the stock had advanced 48.5 per cent in three months from a close of INR 1,170.20 on 14th October.  Under the committee’s plan, Engineers will divide its equity capital in half by issuing two bonus shares for every scrip held, and splitting each unit of a face value of INR 10.00 into two shares of INR 5.00. It is only after this process is complete that the offering will take place.   It will follow the privatisation of a 5.0 per cent stake in electricity generator NTPC in December, which raised INR 85.82 billion from a sale to qualified institutional investors.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The stock closed at 1,568 pence on Wednesday, opened at 1,626p Thursday and hit a high at the time of publication of 1,762p. A bid around the 1,900p per share mark has been mooted  Hammerson plc is Britain\\'s third-largest listed property firm with operations in the UK, France and Germany. The group invests in and develops shopping centres, retail parks and prime offices. Its portfolio of around 1.3 million m² of retail space and over 275,000 m² of prime offices is valued at GBP 6.7 billion. Hammerson\\'s portfolio break down into approximately 70 per cent in retail property and parks with the remainder in offices.  For 2006 the Trust\\'s net income was GBP 1.017 billion up 83.44 per cent from GBP 554.4 million in 2005. Over the same period the Trust recorded a 19.02 per cent return on shareholder funds, down from 22.35 per cent in 2005. Hammerson\\'s profit margin shot up from 81.025 per cent in 2005 to 284.83 per cent in 2006.  At the company\\'s AGM this month Chairman John Nelson confirmed the prospect of the Trust being a target but declared they \"would only consider an offer for the company that it believed fully reflected Hammerson\\'s outstanding investment portfolio, the value of its existing development programme and the substantial value of its pipeline, which provides us with the potential to double the size of the company.\"  KKR and Vornado will sit alongside a long portfolio of names that include UK rivals Liberty International, British Land, and Land Securities; US-based giant GE Real Estate; Australia\\'s shopping centre developer Westfield; and France\\'s Unibail Holding, although the latter is likely to be scratched off the list following its agreement to acquire Dutch-based Rodamco Europe.  A bid for Hammerson looks likely as it has low levels of debt coupled with a diversified portfolio and more importantly an enviable development pipeline.

       " 'Tata Steel is believed to have prevailed in a final round of bidding for India’s bankrupt Bhushan Steel, with what people familiar with the matter have said is an INR 350.00 billion (USD 5.36 billion) offer.   Bloomberg picked up on the recent developments, citing a source in the know, and noted the Mumbai-based suitor submitted an all-cash proposal to the creditors to help accelerate plans to double its capacity to 26.00 million tons in five years.   Through the acquisition, which analysts told the news provider does not look like an attractive or cheap deal by any means, would make Tata Steel the largest steel maker in India, overtaking industry rivals JSW Steel and Sail in terms of volume.   Completion of such a transaction is subject to the group obtaining the necessary approvals, including from the resolution professional, the law tribunal that is overseeing the insolvency process and the competition commission of India.    Bhushan Steel filed for bankruptcy in July last year as the company has outstanding claims of around INR 560.00 billion.   Bloomberg cited S&P Global Ratings as saying Tata Steel will borrow new debt in 2018 to acquire stressed assets after completing a rights issue for repaying loans.   The company, which acquired Bhubaneshwar Power, a thermal power generation service provider, for INR 2.55 billion last month, believes the addition of Bhushan Steel will add about 8.00 million tons a year of capacity to raise its annual spending to an estimated INR 30.00 billion.   JSW Steel was also said to be in the final round of the auction, but missed out as Tata Steel came in with the highest offer.   Bhushan Steel claims to be one of the prominent players in the industry with 5.60 million tons per annum and suggests it is India’s third largest secondary steel production company.  In the nine months to 31st December 2017, the business generated total revenue of INR 129.34 billion, a 22.9 per cent increase on INR 105.26 billion in the corresponding timeframe of 2016.

       " \"Axel Springer may yet find a way to take over German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media, after a federal court decision has allowed it to challenge a previous cartel office veto.  Once again confirming its interest in Unterfoehring-based ProSieben, the publishing house welcomed news that Germany's highest court would favour it over the competition regulator.  Springer had to abandon plans to buy the group early last year after the deal was prohibited due to ProSieben's dominant position in the German television market and Springer's strong influence in the national press.  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Perima eventually took a 50.5 per cent ProSieben stake in March this year for EUR 3.134 billion through their acquisition vehicle Lavena Holding 4.   The group is currently worth around EUR 2.76 billion in equity and since reaching a 2007 high of EUR 30.6 in early July, ProSieben has seen its stocks fall 22.8 per cent to EUR 22.71. It was trading at EUR 25.80 when Lavena took the reigns in March.  With its share price down to levels not seen since the end of last year, it is logical that Springer would still see ProSieben as an attractive target, but the regulatory hurdles it will need to overcome before a deal can be agreed are already painfully apparent.  Springer has not made clear its intentions towards the broadcaster since the federal court ruling. Before the decision was reached, Reuters cited Dirk Schroeder, a lawyer for Springer, as saying the new ProSieben owners would be approached if the cartel office was overturned.  In the wake of the court's ruling, there have also been reports from Thomson Financial that the publisher would not consider a transaction at this time due to another competition rule which blocks not only this deal but others of its kind.     With 24 commercial television stations, 24 premium pay-TV channels and 22 radio networks, ProSieben is one of the largest and most well-established pan European broadcasting companies. It screens programmes from the UK and US alongside Germany-produced material.  In half-year results to June 2007 - the first financials since the private equity buyout - revenues were up 4 per cent to EUR 1.053 billion. Operating profit had grown 7 per cent to EUR 220 million, fed by a 7 per cent increase in EBITDA, which stood at EUR 240 million.   No details of its debt levels were given and investors will need to wait until full-year results are published at the end of the year to asses the full impact of the Lavena takeover.  With ProSieben currently embroiled in the EUR 3.3 billion purchase of Netherlands-based media group SBS Broadcasting, agreed this June, not only will its position as a European television company be strengthened - increasing the likelihood of cartel blocks to a potential deal - but Springer may find the firm saddled with debt.  Its 2006 position looked healthy, with the firm posting gearing of 24.9 per cent, and its EUR 121.769 million net debt covered by EUR 143.302 million net earnings.   However, since its target is seemingly on track to match 2006 revenues of EUR 2.117 billion (FY 2005: EUR 2.003 billion) and has equity of around EUR 2 billion, Springer would be wise to consider the impact of the Dutch takeover and ProSieben's leveraged buyout before making a move.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

At present, MCG has full control over Australia’s leading independent broadcast transmission company.  Broadcast Australia provides transmission for radio and television customers, including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and Special Broadcasting Service (SBS).  The group also offers portal and site-sharing services for local television and radio broadcasters and co-hosts sites for telecoms and emergency service providers. Its sites across metropolitan, regional and rural Australia reach 99 per cent of the population.  It will undergo changes as Australia moves towards full digital coverage by December 2013, though this will bring a host of benefits given that the firm is contracted to provide all of the ABC and SBS's digital transmission services.   The group also owns Hostworks, which manages the availability, performance and running costs of the critical online presence of a portfolio of blue-chip businesses.  Its other subsidiary is The Bridge Networks, which specialises in structural development and installation, and the firm also has a majority stake in Radio Frequency Engineering.

In a statement, the target gave an update on the status of the transaction, noting that following an order from the country’s high court a meeting has been called for 13th March in which stockholders will be able to vote on the deal.  Last October Virgin Australia approached Skywest with a cash and scrip offer of 47.00 Australian cents per share (48.00 US cents), a premium of 67.4 per cent at the time, valuing the Singaporean company at AUD 47.19 million.  While enthusiastic about the generous price being promised, Jeff Chatfield, executive chairman of Skywest, sounded a note of caution by saying the deal will only go ahead if there isn’t a higher bid, and advised stockholders to exercise caution because the transaction “will take some months to fully play out”.  The proposed takeover, which would be effected by way of a scheme of arrangement, also needed the nod from regulators in both countries, namely the Securities Industry Council (SIC) and the High Court in Singapore, and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and Australian Foreign Investment Review Board.  In December the first of these hurdles was cleared when the SIC gave its blessing.  Virgin Australia, formerly known as Virgin Blue, said in a statement that the deal will accelerate its expansion in growing fly-in-fly-out and regional markets, increasing competition in these segments.  It added it will also give it the wherewithal to offer a fully integrated network service and frequent flyer programme.

       " 'Malaysian state investor Khazanah Nasional is poised to take a 10.0 per cent stake in domestic low-cost, long-haul airline AirAsia under a share swap arrangement, an individual with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters today.  Khazanah owns just under 70.0 per cent of Malaysian Airline Systems (MAS), the holding company of Malaysia Airlines, at present.   Various reports have stated that AirAsia is expected to gain control of a 20.0 per cent share in the national carrier as a result of the deal.  Yeah Kim Leng, chief economist at RAM Holdings, told AFP the transaction would benefit the Malaysian airline sector and allow the parties to cut down duplication and share resources.  He added the businesses are complimentary, given Malaysia Airline’s status as flag carrier and AirAsia’s focus on budget travel.  The positive outlook was shared by transport minister Datuk Seri Kong Cho Ha, who was quoted in the Star as saying: “The resulting synergies will especially be obvious in the routes both airlines are flying and it will also reduce their operating costs.  “For a long time, they have been operating on their own. At times, there has been a certain amount of competition between them.”  Khazanah responded to the reports by issuing a statement which denied Tan Sri Tony Fernandes and Dato’ Kamarudin Meranun of AirAsia are to become the single largest shareholders in MAS.  Tony Fernandes, chief executive of the carrier, and deputy Kamarudin also declared the news untrue. Reuters’ source has stated the pair are to take positions on MAS’ board on completion of the deal.

PAI’s proposal, made to selling shareholders IK Investment Partners, Astorg Partners and Intermediate Capital Group, is only preliminary and still needs board approval, les Echos said.  The target’s sale to IK in June 2006 valued it at EUR 150.00 million, the French paper noted.  Cerba claims to be Europe’s largest specialised biology laboratory following its 1998 acquisition of the Pasteur Institute’s specialist medical testing centre.   According to its website, it has a staff of over 550 – including 30 physicians and pharmacists – and conducts more than 1,500 tests in fields such as infectious disease, virology and autoimmune disease, as well as allergy, endocrinology and oncology.  It added an animal heath unit in 2001 and now operates via the five divisions: clinical biology; genetics; pathology and cytology and animal health.  Its most recent acquisition was Belgium’s Bio Analytical Research Corporation in October 2007, which it bought for an undisclosed sum.  Les Echos said Cerba’s sales have doubled under IK, a Nordic private equity firm with EUR 5.70 billion under management.  The business has not been forthcoming with financial information since being taken under private equity control, but according to IK’s website it generated annual revenue of EUR 186.00 million.

Speaking on a conference call with analysts, Fernando González said he hopes the move will lower the group’s debts and related financial expenses.  He added that of the total amount being sold, he intends to jettison USD 500.00 million-worth in 2015 alone.  While the company does carry out asset sales fairly often, this process is likely to be on a much larger scale as González said average annual divestments in the last few years have been around USD 200.00 million.  He blamed Cemex’s indebtedness on acquisitions it carried out prior to the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008.  According to a Wall Street Journal article which picked up on González’s comments, last year debt fell to USD 16.30 billion, from USD 17.50 billion at the end of 2013.  Cemex has already carried out one sale in 2015; in early January it offloaded its activities in Western Germany, particularly in North Rhine-Westphalia, to Swiss peer Holcim.  That deal was originally announced back in August 2013, but was awaiting approval from the European Commission, which was eventually granted in October 2014.  In a concurrent transaction Cemex bought Holcim’s cement plant in Gador and a grinding station in Yeles.  These two deals, combined with another purchase of the Swiss company’s assets in the Czech Republic, were worth EUR 45.00 million, but their individual considerations were not disclosed.

The company has so far denied 0s of a management buyout. It maintains that, while it has received an acquisition offer, nothing has been decided, Reuters said.  Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters a takeover would be led by a consortium of TV broadcasters including Nippon Television Network, Tokyo Broadcasting System and Fuji Media Holdings.  Lenders such as Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ might back the deal, these people added.  Both Reuters and Nihon Kogyo Shimbun claimed Yoshimoto Kogyo would be taken private for JPY 50.00 billion (GBP 320.07 million).

Co-founder Toby Simmons told the newspaper the Melbourne-headquartered company is keen to tap investors for cash to bankroll international expansion and the development of phone applications.  Simmons said: “Funds raised from the Series A will be used to build more features on our mobile platforms and toward localisation to capture the growth in non-English speaking countries like those in Asia.”  Favourit launched a free Apple-friendly iOS application earlier this month and is now working towards releasing an Android version in the next quarter to complement its existing web and mobile HTML offerings.  The company’s platform enables users in 70-plus countries to sign in, either directly or via Facebook, Twitter, Google and Yahoo!, according to the newspaper.  These sports fans and bettors can then access statistics, live scores, video from third parties and social streams. They can wager virtual currency or real cash, depending on which jurisdictions permit such flutters, through some of the world’s top betting operators, including Paddy Power’s Sportsbet and Tabcorp’s Luxbet.  In a nutshell, Favourit does not facilitate the real currency transactions; rather, it allows users to tap into their existing accounts and generates its own revenue streams through commercial partnerships and advertising.  An article by Forbes earlier this month succinctly summed up the reasoning behind the startup, stating it wants to be the Facebook of the sports betting world.  Simmons, who founded Favourit along with his older brother Josh, told the Journal: “We noticed users heading to sports betting platforms were coming from news websites, social media networks, fantasy tipping sites and wanted to wrap everything into one platform.”  The newspaper said the company is aiming to tap into a social gambling industry estimated by Morgan Stanley to be worth USD 2.50 billion.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Neptune Energy has reached an agreement to acquire Verbundnetz Gas (VNG) oil and gas assets in Norway and Denmark for an undisclosed amount.   The buyer, which is an independent exploration and production (E&P) company, is looking to become a leader in its field and has been expanding through acquisitions in recent years.   News of the purchase of VNG’s assets follows the agreement to acquire the oil and gas unit of Engie for EUR 4.70 billion last year.   While the size of the transaction has not been disclosed, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters the operations are worth around EUR 400.00 million.   The assets, referred to as VNG Norge in the press release, comprise a portfolio of production, development and exploration assets on the Norwegian continental shelf, including the Fenja oil development and the Njord production hub.   It has some 42 licences, five producing fields and three development projects, as well as recorded net production of 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2017.  Fenja is a sub-sea development which will be produced as a tie-back to the Njord production hub and is scheduled to come on stream in 2021.   This will boost Neptune’s existing Norwegian portfolio and consolidate its equity position in the Njord area with 22.5 per cent, in addition to the 30.0 per cent interest in Fenja.   Sam Laidlaw, executive chairman at the acquiror, said: “The addition of further long-life oil development opportunities in Norway, through one of our key production hubs, as well as adjacent production and exploration interests, is a further step towards delivering our ambition to create a leading international independent E&P company of significant scale.”  Neptune has activities in the North Sea, as well as North Africa and Asia Pacific, with a production of 165,000 boepd during the first quarter of 2018.   The company is backed by CIC, the Carlyle Group and CVC Capital Partners; however, it was not disclosed if the private equity firms will provide any financing towards the acquisition.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Russian internet juggernaut Mail.ru Group is considering ramping up its strategic interest in the social networking site Vkontakte to a controlling stake, two sources close to the matter told Bloomberg.  According to these people, who declined to be identified as the matter is still private, the web giant has already approached the Saint Petersburg-registered target’s major shareholders.  They noted that backers include the Mirilashvili family with a 40.0 per cent interest, the same size stake as Moscow-based Mail.ru holds in the Facebook social network rival.  When contacted by the news provider, managing director Matthew Hammond said the internet company does not comment on market speculation.  Vkontakte is a leading European social network with over 140.00 million registered users, of which more than 68.0 per cent are over 25 years old.  Around 39.00 million visitors log onto the site every day and about 2.50 billion pages are opened daily, according to the company’s website.  It is Facebook’s largest rival in Russia and was founded by Pavel Durov in 2006, two years before the US company launched its Russian language version.  Vkontakte had initially considered going public but Durov decided to indefinitely postpone the market debut after Facebook’s share price plunged following its initial public offering.  Anastasia Obukhova, an analyst at VTB Capital, told Bloomberg it would make perfect sense for Mail.ru to hike its investment in the networking site.  Obukhova noted that should the company succeed, it would end up controlling three of Russia’s major social networks and would have no big competitors in the country other than the US behemoth.  Mail.ru, which is backed by business magnate Alisher Usmanov, is a leading internet company in the Russian-speaking world and one of the largest in Russia.  The company operates the social networking sites networking sites Odnoklassniki.ru and Moi Mir@Mail.Ru and instant messaging platforms ICQ and Agent.  Along with owning almost a 40.0 per cent stake in Vkontakte, it has 1.3 per cent of Facebook, 4.1 per cent of Groupon and 1.2 per cent of Zynga, according to its website.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Chief executive Sam Malin said the group, which was incorporated in the Isle of Man in 2007, is hoping to float on London Stock Exchange\\'s international market for smaller growing companies in order to raise money to fund future ventures.  “[The Alternative Investment Market] would be the default target but we would also consider listing in Toronto or Australia in that order,” he told the news provider.  Avana believes there are a number of hydrocarbon opportunities in the wider western Indian Ocean/East African margin region; Malin told Reuters the area has “tremendous potential”.  The company is hoping to expand its business and by raising capital it will be able to take advantage of exploration activities in this region.  Malin said: \"Madagascar is a validation of the potential of the area [ . . . ] it could sustain production of more than 100,000 barrels a day and that would result in a sea change in terms of what the region can produce.”  According to Reuters, on 7th July Avana sold a 12.5 per cent stake to the oil exploration group Onslow Resources for between USD 6.00 million and USD 7.00 million.  Malin told the news provider the group will sell more equity in the future in order to widen its shareholder base.  Avana, which has a representative office in London, is headquartered in Antananarivo.  The group already holds a 25.0 per cent participating interest in a 3.70 million acre block in the Seychelles and also owns exploration rights in the Sambaina shale oil area of onshore Madagascar, which is currently under technical evaluation, according to its website.  In January Malin, in an interview with European Oil and Gas magazine, said: “I would really like to see Avana expand beyond Madagascar and to grow into a strong regional business that can eventually look outside of the region.”  He added he wants the company to be respected not only for its “ability to develop oil and gas prospects” but also for the way it is sensitive to environmental issues and promoting the development of the Madagascar region.  “Madagascar is currently in the bottom ten countries in the world in terms of poverty, and if we do it right we hope that we can make a real positive impact on this issue.”  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'The Queensland government is kicking off plans to sell its entire stake in Australian rail freight giant QR National in order to pay down debt, treasury officials told the Australian Financial Review (AFR).  A disposal of a 34.0 per cent interest in the Brisbane-headquartered haulage company was mooted earlier this year and, at the time, was valued at around AUD 3.00 billion (USD 3.14 billion).  The revelation came as Campbell Newman and two senior ministers were sworn in at Brisbane’s Government House in March.  Newman, cited by the AFR, said: “We believe the shares should be sold but only at a time when we can achieve the best price. That is the only thing moving in that space. We said during the ¬campaign there would be no [other] privatisations.”  However, the divestment had to wait until after QR National delivered its fiscal 2012 results, which were announced in August.  Today the proposed privatisation, which is not specifically mentioned in budget papers released this week, is expected to be worth around AUD 2.40 billion and the proceeds have already been factored into future net debt levels, treasury officials told the publication.  QR National claims to be Australia’s largest rail freight operator, moving on average more than 500,000 of tonnes of coal, iron ore, agricultural commodities and other minerals around the country every day.  The transportation provider operates and manages the central Queensland coal network, comprising around 2,600 kilometres of heavyhaul rail infrastructure, and offers design, engineering, construction and maintenance services.  QR National, which listed domestically in November 2010, recorded statutory revenue of AUD 3.63 billion for the year ended 30th June 2012 (FY 2011: AUD 3.29 billion).   The combination of this growth, together with cost reduction and reform initiatives, contributed to a 24.7 per cent rise in underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to AUD 1.05 billion (FY 2011: AUD 840.00 million).

The publication suggested that Aviva - the biggest insurance group in the UK and sixth-largest in the world - will make the move via its Irish insurance arm Hibernian Group, which has activities spanning general insurance, risk management, pensions, life assurance, and personal financial services.  Hibernian\\'s operating profit for 2006 was EUR 188.9 million and gross premium income was EUR 1.4 billion.  Dublin-based Vivas, backed by billionaire financier Dermot Desmond and Allied Irish Bank, provides health insurance for individuals, families and businesses.   In August Vivas kicked off a price war in the health insurance market by offering a 10 per cent discount to all new members.   In announcing the decision chief executive Oliver Tattan said: \"Now is the time to switch to Vivas Health and avail of even greater savings. Consumers can save over 35 per cent on the costs of their health insurance by switching from VHI to Vivas Health. For too long the Irish consumer has been ripped off by the VHI.\"  This PR campaign is a clear indication that Vivas has got state-backed health insurer VHI in its sights.   Last year Vivas lodged a complaint to Brussels, in which it suggested that VHI was allowed to function under different rules from its competitors.  As a result the European Commission has threatened legal action against the Irish government for its decision to continue giving VHI special status. The EC has stated that the company has unfair advantage over its rivals and should not be exempt from standard laws regarding competition.  Last month the Sunday Business Post also claimed that a recent classified report by the Health Insurance Authority showed that VHI is way ahead of its peers with total membership of 1.57 million, which equates to a 75 per cent market share. Quinn Healthcare - which took control of Bupa\\'s Irish business last year - saw its numbers drop by 22,000 to 443,000 (21 per cent market share).  Vivas Health currently only commands 4.6 per cent of the Irish health insurance market with a membership of 96,000.   Chief executive Oliver Tattan claims that the group should have 150,000 subscribers by the end of this year, which would give it a 7 per cent market share. Tattan has also predicted membership would grow a further 33.33 per cent to 200,000 by the end of 2008.  Neither Aviva or Vivas have commented on the conjecture.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",

       " 'French high-end fashion house Hermès International could be on the verge of severing ties with Jean-Paul Gaultier after several potential buyers stepped forward indicating interest in picking up an equity stake in the rival haute couture brand.  While the Paris-based company, which is known for its Birkin and Kelly bags, revealed today it has entered into discussions with these possible suitors regarding its 45.0 per cent holding, it declined to comment on whether it would pare down or sell its entire interest.  Reuters cited analysts to claim the minority stake could be worth several million euros and a disposal would only have a small influence on revenues.  Meanwhile, French daily Les Echos reported the valuations could range from several dozen of million euros to several hundred million euros.  Bloomberg cited Armando Branchini, vice-president of consulting firm Intercorporate, as saying Hermès may sell its equity participation in order to raise funds to help fend off LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which hiked its interest in the handbag designer to 20.0 per cent in December.  Branchini said: “Luxury companies are increasingly focusing on their core business. Also, because of the attack from LVMH, Hermès needs all the liquidity it can get for store openings and other investments. The value of the business would be based mostly on the royalties from Gaultier perfumes.”   According to the Financial Times, the sale has been widely expected after designer Jean-Paul Gaultier stepped down from his position as creative director at the luxury goods manufacturer last year.  Hermès has been tied up with Jean-Paul Gaultier since 1999 when it bought a 35.0 per cent interest for USD 23.00 million. It upped its participation in the fashion house by a further 10.0 per cent in 2008 in a deal reported to be valued at between EUR 3.00 million and EUR 4.00 million at the time.    © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Citing sources, Tencent Finance and the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) both said China Vanke and Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town are also involved in discussions for a stake in the Cayman Islands-incorporated company.  It is not clear at this stage whether Sunac is favourite to pick up an interest, the WSJ noted, although an industry source told Tencent  the group has sent a team to Kaisa headquarters to conduct due diligence.   While talks are focused on an equity stake in the cash-strapped company, asset sales cannot be ruled out, one person said.  Kaisa ran into financial difficulties when local authorities in the city of Shenzhen blocked the developer from selling projects late last year, without giving any reason for the move.  A number of top executives resigned, resulting in the company failing to make a USD 26.00 million interest payment on bonds due to mature in 2020 and this prompted other creditors to demand payment and freeze the group’s bank accounts.   Kaisa’s share price plunged 20.0 per cent on news of the block on the sale of apartments in the three projects and uncertainty about when it would be allowed to start marketing the properties again.  People familiar with the matter told the WSJ at the end of last week that the mainland-headquartered company is looking for ways to tap foreign investors for cash and had entered talks with other Chinese developers to sell assets.   No developer would enter an agreement to take over Kaisa’s holdings without the government’s support, one person told the paper today.  Over the last couple of days, hundreds of homeowners who have purchased un1 properties from the troubled real estate group protested in Shenzhen demanding assurances that their residences would be 1 and handed over on time, the WSJ noted.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The Italian motorway construction company has been making moves for the target for nearly a year, with directors meeting to discuss a possible transaction back in April 2017 and an initial formal cash offer of around EUR 16.34 billion being made a month later.  However, by July, Abertis had also attracted interest from ACS, which, through its German subsidiary Hochtief, made its own EUR 18.58 billion approach for the Madrid Stock Exchange-listed business.  Since then, the suitors had separately continued their takeover bids, until yesterday, when they reached an agreement.  Under the terms, Hochtief will pay around EUR 18.18 billion, or EUR 18.36 per stock for Abertis, representing a 1.2 per cent discount on its closing price of EUR 18.58 on 13th March 2018, the last trading day prior to the announcement.  It will finance the purchase through a EUR 941.48 million capital increase, issuing 6.43 million new shares in ACS at EUR 146.20 apiece.  Atlantia, which will withdraw its previous offer, will then buy about EUR 2.50 billion-worth of scrips in the Germany-based non-residential construction services provider for a stake of just under 25.0 per cent stake.

In regards to this deal, which was announced at the start of the week, the Big Mac creator originally aimed to fetch USD 3.00 billion from the disposal, but instead decided to sell around 32.0 per cent and retain a minority stake to benefit from exposure to future growth in China.

No financial details of the acquisition, which is slated to close in early May of this year, have been disclosed at this time.  Upon completion, current owner Lynwood Investments will retain a minority shareholding, while chief executive James Daunt is set to remain in place.  Waterstones was first named a potential target back in October 2017, when City AM said Alexander tycoon was considering putting the business on the block in a deal which could bring in somewhere between GBP 200.00 million and GBP 300.00 million.  In January of this year, This is Money reported that the company was on the verge of being sold to a private equity investor.

       " 'Pivovary Lobkowicz Group is hoping to tempt investors with an initial public offering (IPO) worth as much as CZK 1.00 billion (EUR 36.33 million), the Czech brewer’s chief executive told Bloomberg.  Zdenek Radil said in an interview the beer producer is keen to join the Prague stock exchange by selling roughly 40.0 per cent of its shares in the second quarter of the year.  Radil told Bloomberg the IPO has already drawn significant interest: “There’s a shortage of actively traded stocks in the Czech Republic and no IPOs, creating surplus liquidity that wants to be invested.  “All institutional investors we’ve met have told us it’s great we’re doing this in Prague because they have a lot of clients who want to buy a new Czech stock.”  Separately a spokesman for the bourse told Bloomberg in an email they are “convinced” the proposed debut would “incite demand [. . .] given that it comes from a new sector that is currently not represented in the market”.  Prospective investors will have to wait for another five months as Lobkowicz, which operates seven breweries, still needs to prepare a prospectus before kicking off a stock offering by the end of June.  However, indicated interest is already positive so the company could even launch a dual-listing in Warsaw, though Prague would be the main market, Radil told Bloomberg.  He added entrepreneur Martin Burda has a 55.0 per cent stake and intends to capitalise loans for shares in order to continue holding a controlling stake, leaving the free-float at about 40.0 per cent.  News of the IPO comes a little more than a month after Radil told the Wall Street Journal there is an uptick in demand for the company’s shares from commercial partners and consumers.  At the time he said proceeds would be used for future development and to bolster the group’s profile as the brewer lags behind rivals such as state-owned Budejovický Budvar and Pivovary Moravskoslezske.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Down to the nitty gritty: the US industry leader is paying USD 150.00 million in cash and assuming obligations worth about USD 245.00 million, comprising interest-bearing debt and remaining instalment payments on vessels under construction.  While it has sweetened the offer by throwing in a potential cash earn out conditional on financial results between 2014 and 2017, the deal is still subject to the usual raft of approvals.  Before it can complete by the end of June, the acquisition will need a rubber stamp from regulators and authorities such as the Norwegian Ministry of Industry and Trade.  Tromsø-headquartered Troms Offshore provides offshore services to oil companies through owning and operating high-end large PSVs built to the clean design class specifications.   Founded in May 2010, the group currently operates a fleet consisting of ten ships, comprising six operated and four owned large clean class PSV’s with more than 1,000 square metres of deck area. It also has two under construction with expected delivery in 2nd quarter 2013 and 1st quarter 2014.  It also manages six further vehicles for other owners through subsidiary Troms Offshore Management, and is particularly focused on operations in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and the Arctic Ocean.  Troms Offshore booked operating income of NOK 168.51 million (USD 29.02 million), earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of NOK 55.12 million and a net loss of NOK 1.16 million for 2011.  It will act as a springboard for Tidewater’s entry into the Barents Sea, Greenland and other cold water markets but will benefit from becoming part of a listed company which can provide the financial backing and resources to help it compete more effectively.  The soon-to-be Texan parent is billed as the world’s largest offshore vessel owner with an active fleet of about 264 and a market capitalisation of USD 2.80 billion.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Argentex noted a listing benefits the reputation of the group and “enhances its growth prospects by significantly increasing its permanent capital base” to meet the growing demand for its services.

The special purpose acquisition company is issuing 13.04 new shares for every one stock owned in the application developer.  Founded in 2009, SundayToz has published programmes on both shared networks and mobile platforms, including Kakao Talk, Apple AppStore, Google Play, Facebook, Mixi, Cyworld, and Naver.  With over 28.00 million users, the studio is the largest social and portable device games developer in South Korea owning a portfolio of simulation and casual puzzles.  SundayToz generated net profit of KRW 7.58 billion (USD 6.71 million) on sales of KRW 23.80 billion in the most recent financial year.  In July last year the group launched Anipang, which is similar to Bejeweled but with fun, cute animal characters.   This match-three brainteaser has proved to be an instant hit, commanding a reported combined 12.00 million monthly active users along with Anipang Mahjong.  In a nutshell, the goal is to match up three of the same creatures either horizontally or vertically to make one combination – and the animals squeak every time users score a combination. The greater the number of groupings produced in a row, the more points won.  This application also enables interaction through the immensely popular Kakao Talk messenger. Anipang lasts just one minute, after which time the user’s score is instantly transmitted to everyone on their contact list who also plays the game, prompting competitiveness.  Considering the game’s popularity and the potential scale behind it, SundayToz is keen to follow in the footsteps of Rovio, which turned Angry Birds into a brand by selling Angry Birds merchandise in the form of plush toys, among other things.  The company has gone down the same route by marketing Anipang characters on items such as smartphone cases and keychains.

       " 'Polaris World Development, the Spanish tourist resort and golf course developer, is considering selling off assets, according to Gaceta de los Negocios.  The Murcia-based tourism real estate company, number two in the domestic market, may allow lenders to take control of certain parts of its business in order to reduce debt, Gaceta de los Negocios said, citing sources close to the company.  The publication claimed Polaris World has been particularly troubled by the fact the economic crisis has stemmed the flow of British tourists into Murcia.  Even before the financial turmoil took hold last year, Polaris World experienced a 39.2 per cent decline in revenue, with the figure falling from EUR 39.47 million to EUR 24.02 million in 2006-07 (FY 2005: EUR 22.15 million; FY 2004: EUR 17.60 million; FY 2003: EUR 8.31 million).  In fiscal 2007 the group made its first pre-tax loss for five years, taking a hit of EUR 2.28 million from EUR 80.86 million profit in 2006.  The news comes as Capital & Corporate Newsletter revealed that the Vizcaya-based travel agency Viajes Eroski intends to sell its tour operating subsidiary Días Libres.  It has been a turbulent 12 months for the European tourism industry, and last week Ireland’s Ryanair, Europe’s leading budget airline, posted its first loss in 20 years.  The UK’s third-largest tour operator XL Leisure collapsed last autumn and the German retail and tourism group Arcandor has been mulling an exit of its 52.0 per cent stake in UK-based Thomas Cook to help it reduce debt.  Yesterday the International Air Transport Association forecast a USD 80.00 billion loss of revenue for the airline industry in 2009.   It said falling demand, collapsing yields, broken consumer confidence and pandemic fears would cause airlines to lose around USD 9.00 billion this year.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'English Championship football side Bolton Wanderers could be the latest team to be acquired as the firm’s chairman enters takeover discussions, according to the BBC.  The broadcaster quoted current head coach Neil Lennon as saying that chairman Phil Gartside has flown to Thailand to conduct talks.  However, he stopped short of giving too much detail, saying that he was unaware whether or not the club would be sold, but that a proposition from some Thai businessmen had been received.  Although he did not identify the interested parties, the BBC said BEC-Tero and Siam Sport Syndicate were previously linked with a joint approach.  Lennon, who has only been at the helm of the Championship side for around a month after being appointed on 12th October, said he was not concerned by the prospect of a takeover, but did concede that it was a strange occurrence given how short his tenure has been.  Bolton Wanderers has been suffering from fading fortunes over the last few years.  After an 11-year period in the lucrative Barclays Premier League, English football’s top division, the club was relegated in May 2012.  It has since been unable to regain its former position and at the time of Lennon’s appointment last month was languishing in last place in the Championship after being victorious in just one of its opening 11 games.  There has been a slight upturn in fortunes since the former Celtic manager took charge; Bolton Wanderers has since played four games, winning two and losing two, and is currently ranked 23rd in the 24 team division.  The club is unlikely to be able to compete with big spending Premier League teams, never mind its Championship compatriots, given the state of its parent’s finances; Burnden Leisure announced debts of GBP 163.80 million in December 2013.  Gartside blamed the loss on the team’s relegation and was backed up by Rob Wilson, a sports finance expert at Sheffield Hallam University, who told the BBC that decreased revenue in the lower leagues limits a club’s ability to pay higher-earning players.  As such, funds will be needed if the team is to be strengthened with a view to returning to former glories and Lennon concluded by saying he would have no problem with a takeover if it was in the club’s best interests.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " \"British retailer Woolworths Group is exploring the sale of its 40 per cent stake in London-based DVD publishing venture 2entertain, it confirmed today in response to press speculation.  Without citing sources, the Telegraph had claimed Woolworths has hired UBS to help it consider its options for the business, which is majority-controlled by BBC's consumer arm BBC Worldwide and claims to be Britain's leading independent video and music publisher.  The two groups created 2entertain in September 2004, combining the video and music publishing, and TV/video production businesses of Woolworths' subsidiary VCI with the video publishing business of BBC Worldwide.  When established, it was the sixth-largest player in the UK video market and the leading British-owned player. Its back catalogue now includes Little Britain and Planet Earth.  The business operates as three distinct units - namely 2entertain Video, Demon Music Group and Banana Split Productions - which together have a turnover of almost GBP 240 million.   According to the Telegraph, Woolworths' 2entertain stake is worth a maximum of GBP 200 million, though the retailer may struggle to fetch this amount given that the BBC has preference over the stake ahead of other bidders.  However, it is understood the venture partners have been in talks with a number of trade and private equity buyers and it is worth noting that back in February there was talk of the BBC wanting to exit part of its stake in BBC Worldwide.  Shares in Woolworths were up 2.33 per cent at 12:20pm today, rising the most in two weeks.   In preliminary 2008 results, the London-based high street retailer's net earnings were down 44.4 per cent at GBP 7.5 billion against an 8.6 per cent sales gain to GBP 2.998 billion.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

German daily Die Welt was first to run the story earlier in the week. Citing an unidentified Deutsche Bahn executive, it claimed the German federal-owned railway is in talks with NTV.  \"The majority and the control will remain under Italian ownership, but we would like to achieve international alliances,\" Giuseppe Sciarrone, the director of NTV, is quoted by Die Welt as saying.  Yesterday, La Tribune said SNCF is also interested in a stake in the Italian rail transport group.   An SNCF spokesperson confirmed talks but would not reveal when they began or how advanced the negotiations are. Deutsche Bahn would not comment on the speculation.  According to Die Welt, the mystery Deutsche Bahn boss said the German group could bring the industry knowledge that NTV\\'s founders are lacking.  The newly-established group plans to run high-speed trains on three routes across Italy by 2011. It will be the first operator of the new Alstom AGV train, which holds the world railway speed record.  NTV will operate a fleet of 25 new trains, linking Turin, Milan and Venice in northern Italy to Rome, Salerno and Bari further south.  The group hopes to serve 20 per cent of the Italian rail passenger transport market by 2015.

Private Equity firm Permira has agreed to take a 29.6 per cent minority stake in the group for EUR 782.6 million and has expressed a desire to purchase the remaining stake.  The group was the subject of speculation on Friday that private equity duo Carlyle and Permira were is separate talks with the company's management to purchase up to half of Valentino. This speculation sent its share price up by nearly 5 per cent on Friday to a close of EUR 35.00, giving the company a market cap of around EUR 2.6 billion. The company was placed in a trading halt yesterday. Pursuant to Italian stock market regulations a single shareholder that acquires a 30 per cent stake in a domestic company is required to make a full public offer for the existing majority. With today's news that Permira has beaten off Carlyle to purchase a minority stake it seems highly likely that a bid for the remainder will be forthcoming.  Valentino has a diversified portfolio of products which includes clothing, accessories, and footwear for men and women and is famous for its long floor-sweeping red gowns. Valentino also has a majority stake in fashion brand Hugo Boss and owns the Marlboro Classics brand.   The group's activities divide into three business segments: Valentino, which includes the brand names Valentino, Valentino Garavani, Valentino Roma and R.E.D. Valentino; Hugo Boss, including the brand names Boss, Hugo and Baldessarini, and licensed brands Marlboro Classics and M Missoni and the Company's own brand names UomoLebole and Principe.  The group's consolidated net sales amounted to EUR 1,963.3 million in the year 2006, up by 13.62 per cent from EUR 1,728 million in the previous year. All business units achieved positive sales with Hugo Boss up 14.2 per cent to EUR 1,495.5 million; Valentino up 14.5 per cent to 239.5 million; Marlboro up 10.1 per cent to 293.3 million. Net income was also up 9.78 per cent to EUR 157.2 million from 143.2 million in 2005. Group's net financial debt was EUR 340.9 million the end of 2006 up from EUR 333.5 million at last year's end.   Permira is a leading European-based private equity firm and acts as adviser to the 19 Permira Funds, totalling approximately EUR 22 billion. The private equity moves for Valentino are no surprise and are in keeping with the recent acquisition of Jimmy Choo for GBP 185 million and last year's intuitional buy-out of Tommy Hilfiger for USD 1.6 billion.\",\n",
       " 'RAOS Voima, a subsidiary of Rosatom, is interested in increasing its holding in Fennovoima from 34.0 per cent to 49.0 per cent, Pekka Ottavainen, chairman of the Finnish nuclear power company, said in an interview with broadcaster YLE.  The acquisition of the initial stake, over which negotiations have been taken place since July last year, was finalised on Monday.  Ottavainen explained that even though Fennovoima does not like the idea of RAOS Voima’s ownership increase, if other participants of the nuclear power plant project are not willing to fund the company then there is no choice but to go with the Russian investor.  In fact, the shareholding of Voimaosakeyhtiö SF, which has the remaining 66.0 per cent, is constantly changing with members exiting and entering, which raises the possibility of the transaction happening, local paper Savon Sanomat concluded.  Ideally, Fennovoima would like to see Finnish ownership at about two-thirds, but under no circumstances wants it to be below 51.0 per cent.  The deal has also drawn attention from Finnish politicians, Savon Sanomat reported, as security concerns regarding Russia have increased recently due to the latter’s takeover of the Crimea region in Ukraine.  However, Ottavainen believes that Rosatom’s objective is to carry out profitable business above all else.  Fennovoima is a Finnish nuclear power plant project company that has contracted Rosatom Overaseas to build an atomic energy station by 2024.   Its other shareholder is Voimaosakeyhtiö SF, which combines the holdings of Finnish businesses and local municipalities that will benefit from the electricity once the facility starts operations.

According to the publication’s Street Talk column, the advisors have already started sounding out interest in a potential sale of the AUD 2.00 billion (USD 1.44 billion) chain and have even held some early-stage discussions with possible suitors.  The article indicated one of the options on the table is a sale to another buyout house or to an international company already operating in the industry, and a formal bidding process is expected to start in the coming months.  Quadrant used Fitness as a vehicle to acquire Goodlife Health Clubs in October 2016, which was followed by Jetts Australia in November and Fitness First Australia in December.  The operations have since been combined under one banner and the business is focused on driving earnings growth, particularly via targeted brand initiatives and new customer propositions, such as investment in technology.  Fitness has over 470 health clubs across the country, Australia, New Zealand and South-East Asia, more than 725,000 members and 25,000+ online programme subscribers, according to its website.  The group now has a total of ten customer-facing brands, which also include Barry’s Bootcamp Asia-Pacific and kubofit.  Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, shows the largest-ever acquisition of a fitness and recreational sports centre was the buyout of Life Time in 2015 for USD 4.00 billion.  Only six other purchases targeting the sector - out of a total 945 deals - have exceeded USD 1.00 billion, including David Lloyd in 2007 (USD 1.88 billion) and Virgin Active South Africa in 2011 (USD 1.60 billion).  Should Quadrant manage to flex its muscles to achieve an AUD 2.00 billion valuation for Fitness, then the sale would be the seventh-largest on record, globally.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Its line-up includes flagship vegan nochicken chunks, vegan naked chickburger and vegan nomince, to name but a few which are stocked in local supermarkets Coops, Ekoplazas and Jumbo, as well as in international chains like Waitrose in the UK.  Korteweg noted the acquisition, which is due to complete before the end of 2018, has come at the right time: “We w ant to take the next step - conquer the world.   “It is our mission to make plant-based ‘meat’ the standard. We believe that with Unilever’s international network, this acquisition will help to accelerate our mission.”  The two teamed up in 2016 to jointly launch the Vegetarian Butcher’s meatballs in satay and tomato saucesunder the brand name Unox.

Investors also reacted badly to Billabong’s profit downgrade blamed on weaker domestic trading and higher-than-expected startup losses from its internet venture SurfStitch Europe.  The company now expects to book earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of between AUD 67.00 million and AUD 74.00 million.  With all this background, it is hardly surprising Billabong is now turning its sights on overall business performance by aggressively cutting costs globally and looking into potential asset disposals, which includes jettisoning West 49.  The company is reported to have hired US boutique investment bank Financo to help find a buyer for its North American youth apparel subsidiary.  A person with knowledge of the situation told the Australian that the process involves potential suitors other than Altamont and Sycamore.  It remains to be seen whether Billabong holds out for a decent price for its subsidiary, which was taken private in June 2010 for CAD 99.00 million (USD 95.73 million at current exchange rates), or opts for a fire sale of assets to quickly repay obligations.  Net debt amounted to AUD 152.20 million as at 31st December 2012 (30th June 2012: AUD 160.90 million) and gearing stood at 21.0 per cent (30th June 2012: 13.5 per cent).  IG market analyst Chris Weston told the Business Spectator it is worth noting that when Billabong released its half-year results in February almost all of its borrowings were classified as current liabilities.  Weston added this suggests there is some urgency to raise cash to pay down debt and the covenants associated with it.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Essel Group may to acquire India-based rural and urban microfinancing company BSS Microfinance for INR 900.00 million (USD 13.13 million), the Business Standard reported.  The paper cited managing director of the buyer Amitabh Chaturvedi as saying the deal is part of the group’s efforts to having a presence in four markets, including small and medium size units, housing and equipment financing.  However, since the report VCCircle cited a senior executive at Essel Finance, who denied any truth to the speculation and added the firm is in talks with a number of micro finance institutions for acquisition but have not decided on any as of yet.  This person said a deal is unlikely to be with BSS, which also stated the media reports were not correct.  The Economic Times (ET) also chimed in on the potential acquisition, likewise cited Chaturvedi as saying the two businesses are in talks and the combination would give Essel Group a presence in 80 rural locations in Karnataka and Maharashtra.  According to the newspaper, the target has hired consultancy firm EY for the transaction.  BSS is a non-deposit taking non-banking financial company, which provides loans of less than INR 2.50 million to each borrower.  The Business Standard cited Brickworks Ratings as saying most of the group’s client base is made up of women.  In the financial year ended 31st March 2015, BSS generated revenue of INR 727.73 million, a 32.6 per cent increase on INR 548.65 million in the previous 12 months.  VCCircle observed that in fiscal 2016 the firm is expected to post net interest income of INR 319.50 million, up on INR 262.30 million in FY 2015.  Essel Group has a presence in a number of sectors such as media, entertainment, packaging, infrastructure and education.  The company’s entities have a combined market capitalisation of over USD 6.00 billion, VCCircle reported.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Dechra Pharmaceuticals has agreed to acquire Eurovet Animal Health, a Netherlands-based veterinary medicine business, from AUV Holding.  The London-listed pharmaceuticals company will pay EUR 135.00 million in cash, on a debt and cash free basis.  Dechra intends to raise around GBP 60.00 million (EUR 72.65 million) in a rights issue to fund the purchase.  The remainder of the consideration will be financed by a new debt facility.  Dechra’s board of directors hopes the firm can benefit from each others’ expertise to improve revenues, sales, growth and product range.  In the rights issue, which will be underwritten by Investec, three new shares will be offered for every 10 existing shares held at GBP 3.00 each.  The acquisition is subject to shareholder approval, which will be sought at a meeting around 14th May, and is expected to complete on 23rd May.  Eurovet is headquartered in Bladel and has a history stretching back to the creation of the Vetimex Production and Trade Association in 1978.  Following AUV’s purchase of the association in 1996, the Eurovet brand was introduced and in 2001 was merged with the Vetimex and Farvet names to create the company we know today.  Dechra is headed by chief executive Ian Page and develops veterinary-focused pharmaceuticals.  The company was formed as a result of a management buy-out from Lloyds Chemist in 1997, and listed on the London Stock Exchange in September 2000.  It generated revenue of GBP 389.24 million in fiscal 2011, up 5.4 per cent on the previous year.  The acquisition and rights issue are not dependent on one another, and should the purchase fail to complete, proceeds of the rights issue will be returned to shareholders.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Amgen is acquiring Istanbul-based Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals in an all-cash deal that values the injectable generic drug maker at USD 700.00 million.  According to the terms of the agreement, the bidder will purchase a 95.6 per cent stake in MN, significantly expanding the US biotechnology group’s presence in the country which it describes as a priority market.  Speaking about the deal, Amgen president Robert Bradway said: \"Together with MN\\'s staff and management team, we plan to grow our business with high quality and innovative medicines in Turkey and the surrounding region.\"  Last September, the Wall Street Journal broke the news that US pharmaceuticals giant Eli Lilly was in talks that could potentially lead to an investment in the Turkish company.  It later emerged that about six bidders, among them GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, were also interested in picking up a stake in MN in a deal that valued the business at USD 1.00 billion.  These two made it through to the second round of bidding last month, according to sources familiar with the development.  According to its website, MN is one of the leading, and oldest, pharmaceutical companies in the country.  Established in 1923, the business was originally called Mustafa Nevzat Laboratory and employed just eight people.  It was one of the first drug makers in Turkey to focus on injectables.  Today MN has 1,200 staff, and is one of the country’s foremost manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished dosage forms.  Reuters observed that sales of medicines in emerging markets are growing at a faster rate than in Europe and the US, making them attractive targets for overseas companies like Amgen.  Data from Zephyr shows there have been a number of deals involving Turkish drug companies in recent years.  Among them was the EUR 130.00 million acquisition of generics business Dr F Frik by Italy’s Recordati last September.  In 2007 Zentiva bought a 75.0 per cent stake in two of Eczacibasi’s pharmaceutical distribution divisions in a EUR 460.00 million deal, later purchasing the remaining 25.0 per cent for EUR 171.38 million.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Australian brewer Foster’s has announced a shareholder meeting to discuss demerger plans for its Treasury Wine Estates subsidiary.  The Victoria-based company aims to spin off the business into an entity that will trade on the Australian Securities Exchange.  The operation takes the form of eligible stockholders receiving one share in the new public firm for every three held in the vendor, and is expected to finalise on 16th May.   Investors who are not qualified due to being resident in certain countries will instead receive proceeds from the sale of units they would otherwise be entitled to.  The plan has been judged in the best interest of stockholders by independent expert Grant Samuel.  Foster’s has said both firms will benefit from the opportunity to concentrate on their own business and objectives, while shareholders own separate investments in each, allowing them greater choice over the size of their holdings.  It also gave increased expenses, credit risk and demerger costs as downsides to the plan, although its directors have unanimously supported it.  Treasury Wine Estates covers activities in Australia and New Zealand, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa and Asia. Its brands range from premium to commercial names, and include Beringer, Wolf Blass, Penfolds and Castello di Gabbiano. Total annual sales are over 35.00 million cases.  Foster’s began looking into options for its wine activities in 2008, but decided in 2009 to retain the business due to the economic situation at the time. Last July it began trading under its current name.  Treasury Wine Estates reported some positive trends for the first half of fiscal 2011. This included growth in Asia, with a larger Chinese distribution market, gains in continental Europe and the Nordic nations and a 5.0 per cent increase in earnings before interest and tax for the Australia-New Zealand region.  It reported a “modest recovery” in consumer spending in the Americas, although this had still not reverted to the levels of three years previously.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

According to a term sheet cited by the newspaper, the Suzhou-based firm is selling 375.00 million stocks, equating to 36.6 per cent of its enlarged share capital, priced between HKD 1.88 and HKD 2.28 (USD 0.24 and USD 0.29) apiece.  Hong Kong newspaper The Standard reported that the IPO roadshow kicks off today.  In addition to being a small loans provider, Huirong Financial also operates a network of pawn shops.  Meanwhile, Bank of Chongqing is meeting investors to test the waters for a proposed USD 500.00 million to USD 600.00 million IPO in Hong Kong and the plan is for shares to start trading on 6th November, a person with knowledge of the matter told the Financial Times.  Huishang Bank is also poised to list next month once it completes a massive USD 1.00 billion stock offering.  The Financial Times observed that Chinese lenders have been adversely affected by a domestic credit crunch over the summer, precluding the possibility of going to the public markets.  However, the picture is improving as investors turn away from south Asia and return to the country, bringing with them renewed confidence in its markets and thus prompting bank valuations to pick up again, the paper said.  Earlier this year, before the credit crunch struck, another company operating in the same segment as Huirong Financial made its public debut in Hong Kong.  Oi Wah Pawnshop Credit Holdings also listed on the exchange in March, when it raised HKD 98.00 million in an IPO.  In a different sector, Chinese menswear designer Cabbeen Fashion is looking to net USD 100.00 million in its stock offering.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Nasdaq-listed biopharmaceuticals producer Cadence Pharmaceuticals has received an offer to buy the company from Ireland-headquartered Mallinckrodt, a maker of generic drugs and imaging agents.  Under the terms of the transaction, the Dublin-based firm will pay USD 14.00 per share in the target via an unnamed subsidiary, valuing the entire business at USD 1.21 billion.  The offer represents a premium of 26.5 per cent over Cadence Pharmaceuticals’ close of USD 11.07 on 10th February.  Commenting on the planned acquisition, Mallinckrodt’s chief executive, Mark Trudeau, said it is in line with the buyer’s plan to become a leader in the speciality pharmaceuticals sector worldwide, adding that the target’s Ofirmev product will be a good addition to its range.  The drug is the first acetaminophen injection available in the US and is designed to treat analgesia, as well as manage severe pain and reduce fevers.  Ted Schroeder, chief executive of San Diego-headquartered Cadence Pharmaceuticals, added: “We believe Mallinckrodt is a natural fit to provide the resources and expertise that can expand patient access for Ofirmev.   “Additionally, this transaction will provide Cadence shareholders with a strong return on their investment.”  Financing for the deal will be provided using existing cash on hand, as well as debt funding from Deutsche Bank Securities.  Completion remains subject to customary terms and conditions, as well as the green light from the target’s shareholders and expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and is expected to occur during March.  The deal has already been approved by the boards of both companies.  Last month Cadence Pharmaceuticals said it expects net product revenue from sales of Ofirmev for the year ended 31st December 2014 to be between USD 173.00 million and USD 177.00 million.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

There has been speculation for several years that the French vehicle manufacturer might exit its Volvo stake of around a fifth. It has always denied such claims but times are harder than they have ever been.  Its response to the refreshed 0 yesterday was no different to usual: “We aren\\'t in any discussions about disposing of our shareholding,\" a spokeswoman told Dow Jones Newswires.  Neither Volvo, nor the 0ed bidder Investor, which is the holding company of Sweden’s Wallenberg family, would respond to requests for comment.  Volvo’s stock advanced as much as 4.0 per cent on the report but closed 0.9 per cent down.  The Gothenburg-based company has a market cap of SEK 61.80 billion (GBP 5.24 billion) meaning Renault’s 20.1 per cent holding is worth SEK 12.42 billion in the markets.  Its shares have held well in 2009 despite crisis in the auto industry; since 2nd January they have lost 5.8 per cent of their value.  It is a diversified vehicle manufacturer, with a presence in construction equipment, buses, trucks and aeronautics, as well as financial services and yachts.  The group was worth SEK 303.67 billion in 2008 revenue after a 6.0 per cent increase from SEK 285.41 billion in 2007. It was boosted by record sales and profit in the first half, to be brought back down to earth by the economic crisis in H2.  Operating income for the full year was SEK 15.85 billion – an annual decline of 28.7 per cent (FY 2007: SEK 22.23 billion).

       " 'UK-headquartered information assurance company NCC Group has unveiled plans to divest its software testing unit.  The company did not provide many details on the planned sale, other than to say it is ongoing.  NCC has separately closed the previously announced divestment of its web performance business, which has been acquired by Eggplant for GBP 7.50 million on a debt- and cash-free basis.  The decision to jettison the unit came following a strategic review, which was concluded in July of last year and established that the division had little strategic overlap with the company’s broader cyber security and business continuity operations.  As such, it was thought that the asset would perform better under new ownership more aligned to its core activities.  NCC intends to concentrate on its assurance and escrow segments as a consequence.  No details as to when completion of the software testing unit sale can be expected to complete have been disclosed at this time, although the firm did state that it will issue its financials for the year to 31st May on 17th July.  London-listed NCC describes itself as a global expert in cyber security and risk mitigation.  The Manchester-headquartered firm employs close to 2,000 people at over 35 offices worldwide and has a customer base numbering 15,000.  NCC posted revenue of GBP 118.20 million in the first half of 2018, compared to the GBP 110.30 million generated over the corresponding timeframe of 2017 and GBP 107.50 million in the second half of last year.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed but the Scottish group will more than double the assets managed by its private equity unit to about USD 15.00 billion and add 50 investment professionals.  It will also boost the company’s broader alternatives platform to USD 21.30 billion.  Closing is slated for the third quarter, subject to approval from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission and US regulators.  Flag Capital focuses on venture capital, small- to mid-cap private equity and real assets in the US, as well as investing in Asia-Pacific.  Aberdeen said the addition of the Connecticut-based firm’s presence across institutional and high net worth client segments increases its own exposure to the region and strengthens its activities in family offices, endowments and public and corporate pension plans.   The asset manager has been seeking to expand in the US and broaden its investment portfolio in alternative classes such as private equity and debt, hedge funds, real estate and infrastructure.   Chief executive Martin Gilbert commented: “This transaction is in line with Aberdeen’s strategy of undertaking clear value-added acquisitions that will assist with accelerating business growth in this area.”  He went on to note that the purchase of Flag meets this objective by strengthening the group’s private market capability by bringing in further Asian knowledge and a new US base.  The deal is the largest undertaken by the group since it took over Scottish Widows Investment Partnership from Lloyds Banking Group in 2014.    Aberdeen has 33 offices in 27 countries and total assets under management of GBP 330.60 billion as at 31st March 2015.

The Chinese non-ferrous metal producer and trader announced plans to issue up to 439.69 million new shares, representing a 29.3 per cent enlarged stake to no more than ten qualified investors.  At CNY 6.55 apiece, the proposed sale is a 15.0 per cent discount to the close of CNY 7.71 on 26th November before stocks were halted from trading.  Investors bid up shares by 3.2 per cent to CNY 7.96 on news of the cash call and capital injections, once the suspension was lifted, to value the company at CNY 11.92 billion.  Chengtun intends to use proceeds to take part in a CNY 1.00 billion-private placing by subsidiary Shanghai Chengtun Commercial Factoring.  The company is pumping CNY 319.00 million into joint venture Shenzhen Chengtun Financial Leasing while partner and indirect wholly-owned business Shanghui, which will hold a 25.0 per cent stake, is injecting CNY 101.00 million.  Finally, Chengtun is planning to introduce CNY 700.00 million into metal trading arm Chengtun Metal to help finance the construction of warehouses.  The cash call comes just five months after the company raised CNY 1.04 billion through a private placing of 145.32 million shares, representing a quarter of its enlarged capital, at CNY 7.14 apiece.  At the time proceeds were earmarked to finance the acquisition of Shenzhen Chengtun Equity Investment for CNY 703.80 million and Guizhou Huajin Mining.

       " \"Japanese fire protection systems maker Nippon Dry Chemical (NDC) has announced talks with its parent Tyco International, stoking speculation that it could be coming up for auction.  A report from Reuters on Monday, citing NDC official Sho Abe, said Tyco and NDC are in negotiations and will make an announcement by the end of the week, without clarifying the exact purpose of the talks.  The loss-making Tokyo fire protection company, which makes chemical fire extinguishers, fire engines and security systems such as sprinklers and alarms, was delisted after Tyco acquired it in September 2000.  It recorded a loss of JPY 180.39 million (USD 1.631 million) on revenues of JPY 17.024 billion in fiscal 2006, making it a prime sale target for Bermuda-incorporated Tyco, which last year divided its own operations into the three smaller operating units of Codivien (formerly Tyco Healthcare), Tyco Electronics and Tyco International.   NDC's sales fell from JPY 19.548 billion in 2003 to JPY 17.283 billion in 2004 and have not broken the JPY 18 billion mark since this time (FY 2005: JPY 17.928 billion; FY 2006: JPY 17.204 billion).  Aggravating last year's JPY 229.464 million loss is the fact that NDC has spent just one of the last five fiscal periods with its bottom line in the black.   Profit before tax on the other hand has been positive since 2003, though growth has not been sustained (FY 2006: JPY 71.094 million; FY 2005: JPY 84.07 million; FY 2004: JPY 73.397 million; FY 2003: JPY 176.799 million).   Tyco has been working to repair an image damaged by former chief executive Dennis Kozlowski and former chief financial officer Mark Swartz having looted millions of dollars of company funds.  It spun off Tyco Electronics and Covidien in separate New York listings in January 2006, adding to the list of over 20 divestitures made since the turn of the decade.  According to BvD data these unit sales have gone alongside net debt reductions from a high of USD 54.53 billion in 2001 - which stood at 137-times net earnings of USD 3.971 billion - to USD 7.247 billion net debt in 2006.

       " 'A 55.0 per cent stake in Trinidad and Tobago’s Republic Bank could be on the block as the country’s government and central bank work on a divestment plan, according to local media reports.  Central Bank’s governor, Ewart Williams, told the Trinidad & Tobago Express that they are working towards the best disposal solution of the equity holding.  The majority stake can be valued at about TTD 7.60 billion (GBP 859.07 million) as stock closed at TTD 86.00 on 13th February.  The Port of Spain-based institution, which is Trinidad and Tobago’s largest commercial bank, has a current market capitalisation of around TTD 13.81 billion.  In response to questions at a briefing, Williams told the Express: “No matter who gets the shares, the resources will return to the government.”  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, one of Canada’s top five commercial banks, has the 172-year-old Republic Bank in its sights and is pushing for talks, according to local media reports.   However, it will be one of several institutions interested in taking control of the West Indies bank which held total assets of TTD 40.91 billion as at 31st December 2008 (30th September 2008: TTD 41.57 billion).  Unaudited net profit attributable to shareholders declined 2.5 per cent to TTD 276.82 million, showing a basic profit per share of TTD 1.72 in the first quarter ended 31st December 2008 (Q1 2007: TTD 266.83 million, or TTD 1.67).  CL Financial, the largest privately-held conglomerate in Trinidad and Tobago and one of the largest privately-held corporations in the entire Caribbean, officially holds the stake in Republic Bank.  However, the collapse of this giant, which started out as a holding company for Colonial Life Insurance Company (Trinidad) in 1993, meant the government had to step in.  CL, which held TTD 100.67 billion-worth of assets in 2007, has been forced by the country’s central bank to cede control of large portions of its operations as part of a financial rescue package.  The divestment of 55.0 per cent of Republic Bank will be used to fill the breach left in the statutory fund of its insurance subsidiary and other struggling CL Financial companies, the Express reported.  “We will use the resources to fill the gap, this is not in doubt, it is going to happen,” Williams told the newspaper.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " \"As whispers of divestments continue to focus on Babcock & Brown's Eircom assets, the Irish firm's mobile phone mast unit is the latest cause of speculation.  The Dublin-based fixed and wireless telecoms operator has drawn up a shortlist of six potential buyers for the business, an ireland.com report published on Eircom's website said on Friday.  Among the bidders are believed to be eTel Group founder Sean Melly, who has made an offer of over EUR 150 million through his private equity firm Powerscourt Investments.   Mr Melly is seeking new investments, with eTel in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland about to be taken on by Telekom Austria for EUR 90 million.  UK mobile group Arqiva, which is owned by a consortium led by Australia's Macquarie, is also thought to be among the suitors.   Babcock, which bought Eircom in 2006, is seeking a sale and leaseback of the 300 Irish mobile phone masts. The Irish group's mobile network Meteor is the main user, though rivals Vodafone, O2 and 3 are also customers.   A look at the Dublin company's debt situation gives clear indication of the need for a sale. Its total liabilities and debt stood at EUR 3.613 billion in 2006 and has been around the EUR 3 billion mark since 2003.   Eircom's inability to manage debts at current levels - demonstrated by 2006 gearing of 464.62 per cent (FY 2005: 730.13 per cent) illustrates the urgency with which assets must be sold off, particularly given the present fears surrounding global credit supply.  Last year, net assets of EUR 591 million stood against net debts of EUR 2.056 billion (FY 2005: EUR 375 million to EUR 1.975 billion respectively), suggesting Eircom must raise cash quickly, although its new Australian owner has always talked of separating it into mobile network and retail units.   The regulatory burdens associated with erecting new masts will ensure favourable interest in the business, while Eircom's EUR 1.8 billion retail and mobile units were attracting the attention of BT last month.   Its other assets include Ireland's fixed-line telephone network, which Babcock has expressed a desire to retain as it is the most profitable part of the business.   However, with the Sydney firm to publish 2007 results this week and expecting a loss on redundancy payouts at Eircom, it will be looking to recoup some of its investment.   Whether it is the mobile and retail units or the mobile masts business, a sale announcement looks imminent.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

Shares in Debenhams fell 3.9 per cent to 24.50 pence at 10.38 am GMT today from 25.50 pence on 29th December.  Private equity firms TPG and CVC, both of which are leading shareholders in the company, are thought to be supportive of the business, though it is not certain how they will feature in the fundraising scheme.  The retailer is not expected to come close to breaching banking limits on its debt for at least another six months, the FT reported.  It had net debt of GBP 994.00 million at the year ended 30th August. This is a 2.2 per cent improvement, or GBP 22.50 million, over the position of GBP 1.02 billion at 1st September 2007.  Debenhams is moving to lessen the negative impact the deteriorating economic and retail climate is having on its balance sheet. Such actions include cost reductions, lower capital expenditure and decreasing store stock density.  It is set to release an interim management statement, which will include a Christmas trading update, on 6th January 2009.  The group has around 140 stores in the UK and Republic of Ireland and 10 Desire by Debenhams outlets. It has a further 44 international franchise shops in 15 countries and an online catalogue.

The buyer claims to be the world’s largest converter of pressure sensitive and extruded film materials, with over 20,000 employees in 167 manufacturing facilities in 37 countries.  Its products have a range of decorative, instructional, functional and security applications and a used by government institutions, along with other clients in the packaging, healthcare, chemicals, and automotive industries.  CCL Industries anticipates adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) to reach USD 55.00 million by 2021 as a result of the acquisition.  Chief executive Geoffrey Martin said the deal “gives Innovia a solid strategic footprint for BOPP films in both North America and Europe, with highly complementary technologies and products”.  Martin described the combination of firms under a common brand as an “important new strategic initiative in the materials science arena”.   Treofan Americas operates in the US and Canada, as well as across Latin America, and has the capacity to produce 60,000 tonnes of BOPP film, which can be used for speciality applications in the consumer packaging and label markets.  Towards the end of 2018, the division intends to build a ten-metre wide BOPP extrusion line, which will increase production capacity by 30,000 tonnes and require an expansion to its Mexican facilities.   Construction costs from this additional project, estimated to reach USD 65.00 million, will be added to the purchase price at completion.  In 2017, Treofan Americas generated adjusted EBITDA of USD 40.00 million and sales totalling USD 212.00 million, 65.0 per cent of which can be attributed to transactions in the US, from its North Carolina-based sales office and distribution centre.  Private equity firm M&C, which is listed in Milan, will retain the Treofan trading name, along with the European businesses, following the sale.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'General Mills is entering the pet food category through the acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products for an enterprise value of USD 8.00 billion in an attempt to offset intense competition in the packaged food industry.  Investors pushed up shares in the 16-year-old, Connecticut-based manufacturer of natural meals and treats for dogs and cats in pre-market trading to 16.9 per cent by 06:11 local time on the news.  General Mills is offering USD 40.00 per share in order to gain full control of a company operating in the USD 30.00 billion US pet food market, which is generating consistent growth of 3.0 to 4.0 per cent.  Furthermore, the deal puts the Minnesota-based manufacturer known for its Cheerios and Häagen-Dazs brands firmly ahead in the wholesome natural category by getting its hands on the Blue brand.  General Mills noted this market represents about 10.0 per cent of the overall pet food sector in terms of volume and about 20.0 per cent in value.  Blue Buffalo is billed as a leader in the burgeoning wholesome natural category, with double-digit growth over each of the last three years and retail sales that are four-times the next largest brand.  The group delivered compound annual net sales and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) growth of 12.0 per cent and 18.0 per cent, respectively, over the timeframe.    With all this success, it only feeds about 3.0 per cent of pets in the US and represents a significant opportunity for General Mills to build up a presence in the overall sector.   The all-cash deal represents a 23.0 per cent premium to Blue Buffalo’s 60-day volume weighted average price, and also equates to a multiple of about 22x 2017 adjusted EBITDA.  General Mills expects to have pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.2x following the acquisition, but said it plans to deleverage to 3.5x by the end of fiscal 2020.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'The Russian government might take a 28.0 per cent interest in Aeroflot, the country’s largest airline by passenger traffic, from the National Reserve Corporation, according to Kommersant.  Pravitelstvo Rossii would take control of the stock, which is worth around USD 531.76 million in the markets and could eventually be passed to the defence company Rostekhnologii.  In exchange for 28.0 per cent of Moscow-based Aeroflot, Rostekhnologii could give up shares in six smaller Russian airline operators including GTK Rossiya, Vladivostok Avia and Dalavia, the Russian finance paper said.  Another alternative would be for Aeroflot and Rostekhnologii, which was established in 2007 by the then president Vladimir Putin, to create a holding company which would own the aforementioned assets, Kommersant added.  Aeroflot’s origins date back to the early 1920s, making it one of the oldest airlines in the world.   It had been the Soviet Union’s carrier and still bares the Russian flag; needless to say it is one of the Kremlin’s key strategic businesses despite having been partially de-nationalised in recent years.  It is among an ever decreasing number of profitable passenger air transport companies. In the year to 31st December 2008 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation stood at USD 527.00 million.  Revenue was more than a fifth higher year-on-year in 2008 at USD 4.63 billion (FY 2007: USD 3.82 billion; FY 2006: USD 3.01 billion).  With a fleet of 114 aircraft, Aeroflot runs a consolidated route network covering 856 destinations in 169 countries and accounts for over 42.0 per cent of Russia’s regular international traffic.   Rostekhnologii is a major arms dealer via its principle operating subsidiary Rosoboronexport.  It has long been buying up blocks of government shares in several major Russian aviation companies and on its website it says the resulting business “may surpass Aeroflot in terms of combined volume of transportation in the domestic market”.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Lion Capital is mulling ways of making a return on its seven-year investment in AS Adventure Group, after acquiring the Belgian outdoor equipment and clothing retailer in 2007 for EUR 263.00 million, De Tijd reported.  According to the newspaper, the UK private equity house focused on the consumer sector has hired Rothschild to work on a strategic review, which is normally a code word for a sale, though the exit could also come in the form of an initial public offering.  It added Lion Capital controls 85.0 per cent of the business, with founder and former chief executive Emiel Lathouwers, management and other shareholders mopping up the remainder.  AS Adventure is a speciality retailer operating under the banner AS Adventure in Belgium, Cotswold Outdoor in the UK and Bever in the Netherlands.  The Antwerp-headquartered company sells outdoor equipment and clothing for biking, trekking, climbing, skiing and camping and employs over 1,800 people, according to Lion Capital’s website.  It claims its retailing formats AS Adventure and Bever are the clear market leaders in Belgium and the Netherlands, respectively, while its UK brand also enjoys a prominent sector position.  At the time Lion Capital came on board, AS Adventure had annual net sales of EUR 205.00 million, which have since climbed to EUR 335.00 million in 2012.  The private equity house acquired the business from founder Emiel Lathouwers and partner Mitiska, which in turn bought a 50.0 per cent stake in 1998 and helped build up the retailer from just three stores in Antwerp and revenue of EUR 15.00 million.  As part of the expansion drive AS Adventure took over Cotswold Outdoor, which had 11 outlets in the UK and turnover of EUR 28.50 million at the time of the deal in 2000.  Seven years later it beefed up its continental presence with the acquisition of Dutch retailer Bever Zwerfsport, adding another 29 stores and a turnover of EUR 45.80 million to its growing portfolio.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Kenyan car dealer CMC Holdings has been approached over a possible takeover, chairman Joel Kamau Kibe said, almost two years after its shares were suspended from trading on the country’s stock exchange.  Speaking at the annual general meeting, Kibe stated that due diligence on the company is in progress and the results will be out in a few months, the Daily Nation reported.  The paper quoted him as confirming a potential strategic partner has come forward but it is not yet clear whether the suitor will opt for a full takeover or a partnership, noting that shareholders will be consulted once an offer is made.  In September 2011 shares in CMC were suspended for a week following allegations of fraud involving its former chairman, Peter Muthoka, who was ousted from the board.  Since then there has been ongoing boardroom controversy that eventually resulted in the entire executive tier being replaced.  At its last price of KES 13.50 (USD 0.16) on 11th June, the group can be valued at around KES 7.87 billion.  Bloomberg cited Kibe as saying the issues arising from the fraud probe are being settled so as to safeguard the company’s “continued viability”.  CMC is the parent of CMC Motors Group, Cooper Motor Corporation Uganda, Hughes Motors and Hughes Agriculture, both based in Tanzania, as well as a third of Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers.  The Nairobi-based group is a leading player in the East African motor industry distributing a number of major car brands, including Ford, Mazda, Volkswagen and Suzuki, the MAN range of trucks and buses, Iveco and Bobcat tractors and agricultural implements.  Both the Daily Nation and Bloomberg noted the news of a possible takeover comes after CMC lost an exclusive franchise for Jaguar Land Rover sales in Kenya and Uganda, which represented 23.0 per cent of 2012 sales.  The group is Kenya’s fourth largest car dealership by sales and had an 11.0 per cent market share in the first five months of this year, Bloomberg said, citing figures from industry lobby group the Kenya Motor Industry Association.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",

GE agreed to buy the business back in November; under the terms of the transaction it will pay USD 1.65 billion for the company.  The deal, which will represent an exit for current investor Doughty Hanson, is expected to close at some point during the first half of 2017.

J&F currently owns an 80.8 per cent stake in Vigor, with JBS holding the balance.

It employs over 200 people and has been making equipment used in photovoltaic products since 1994 when it began producing laminators.  The group has operated a US sales subsidiary since 1996 and Germany has been firmly fixed on its radar for over a decade.  NPC’s European base, located in Cologne, was established 11 years ago to be followed eight years later with a Berlin branch.  However, the two sites service products made in Japan rather than directly producing laminators.   Meier, which designs and makes encapsulating equipment for solar modules, is a ready-made springboard into the region.   It claims to have the largest number of laminators installed worldwide, counting over 280 units.

The sale of the government's holding in Bundesdruckere was part of a raft of privatisation programmes and at the time sparked concern among employees that the company would be broken up, which resulted in strikes and demands for job guarantees.  It is not yet known whether the 1,400 people employed by Bundesdruckerei worldwide will be quite as active during these negotiations.   Giesecke & Devrient, which will allegedly take control of Bundesdruckerei, specialises in banknote and securities printing as well as automatic currency processing equipment and electronic security solutions. Based in Munich also, Giesecke & Devrient should provide an ideal new home for Bundesdruckerei.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Paris-based CNP has inked a deal to acquire a majority stake in Santander’s life and non-life insurance business in a move to expand its reach in the European market.  Under the deal the French suitor will acquire a 51.0 per cent control in three of the Spanish group’s subsidiaries in Ireland for EUR 290.00 million.   The base consideration may be adjusted depending in the companies’ future performance.   CNP will use its cash reserves to fund the purchase, which will close by the end of 2014 subject to regulatory green light.  With over 12.00 million clients, the Santander subsidiaries generated combined revenues of nearly EUR 600.00 million in calendar 2013.  The purchase will allow Santander to book a capital gain of EUR 250.00 million.   Once the deal closes, CNP will add coverage, including payment protection products, throughout ten European countries to its portfolio list.  CNP is a leading insurance firm in France with premiums worth about EUR 28.00 billion and EUR 300.00 billion in assets, excluding unit-linked portfolios, as of 31st December 2013.   It is also a major player in Europe and Latin America, claiming to be the third and the fifth largest insurer, respectively.  CNP employs 4,800 employees worldwide.  The deal would represent yet another divestment by Santander. Last month, it agreed to sell a 50.0 per cent stake in its custody businesses in Spain, Brazil and Mexico to Warburg Pincus and Temasek Holdings for EUR 487.50 million.

       " 'Luzhou Xinglu Water is opening up its retail book today, hoping to pique the interest of investors in gaining exposure to Sichuan province’s second-largest water-related utility by market share in terms of tap water sales volume.   With a dominant position in the prefecture-level city, the services provider aims to expand into other geographical areas and diversifying operations and business opportunities.  Despite having massive volume of water resource at around 2,831 billion tons, China is one of the world’s most deficient countries as its per capita freshwater resource of 2,059 tons is less than a third of global average.  However, the shortage is exacerbated by the country’s growing demand which is driven by rapid economic development, growing and increasingly urbanised population.  It is further compounded by widespread pollution resulting in a need for more supply plants and wastewater treatment and recycling.  Sichuan province is one of the most developed provinces in western China, with a well-established municipal wastewater supply capacity of 13.30 million tons per day in 2015, which is expected to reach 16.10 million tons in 2020.  Xinglu Water is the dominant municipal water-related utility in the Luzhou region: the largest tap water supplier in terms of capacity with a market share of 83.0 per cent and the only wastewater treatment service provider.  The business is raising up to HKD 543.80 million (USD 70.03 million) by opening up its capital to new investors through the sale of 214.94 million new and existing shares at as much as HKD 2.53 apiece.

Nrupaditya Singhdeo said the target is to double student capacity from 14,000 to 28,000 over the next two years and while growth is not focused on the number of facilities, it does have two acquisitions in mind at the moment.  The Dubai-based company invests and manages nurseries, primary and secondary schools, and colleges and universities in the Middle East and North Africa and Southeast Asia regions.  Founded in March 2012, Al Najah also operates professional training institutes for languages, exams preparation and personal development, among other things.  The ceo said the company has set its sights on acquiring a school in Abu Dhabi and another in either Kuwait or Qatar in the next eight months, adding to a portfolio which already includes sites in Dubai and Oman.  He told Arabian Business that investment between USD 100.00 million and USD 150.00 million has been put to one side for the proposed two-year expansion programme.  “We want to invest [ . . . ] to build our business and scale it up to a size so that is a visible business which could either be listed or we could do a trade sale,” Singhdeo added.  Al Najah will then find the best market for an education provider to list on, though it is leaning towards holding an IPO in the US or Singapore and ruled out floating on a bourse in the Gulf Cooperation Council region.  Singhdeo told Arabian Business the group may well hold a primary capital increase of between USD 200.00 million and USD 250.00 million, followed by USD 250.00 million in its first public share sale.  “So it ultimately becomes a billion-dollar company when you do the valuation.

       " 'DNZ Property Fund was rebuffed in an initial approach to take over rival New Zealand-based real estate investor Argosy Property Trust – a deal which would create a major force in the market.  In a stock exchange announcement, DNZ’s chairman Tim Storey said the target’s directors “have so far declined to engage constructively”.  Argosy described the proposal – which came verbally rather than in writing – as “uncompelling”, though it has asked for written details.  Storey said combining the two listed property trusts would create an internally managed New Zealand commercial portfolio of “significant scale and diversification across sectors and geography”.   Both firms are part of the NZD-50 index. DNZ is the smaller of the two with a market value of NZD 334.23 million (USD 365.13 million) to its target’s NZD 439.35 million.  With offices in Auckland, Wellington and Queenstown, DNZ has around NZD 700.00 million of commercial assets under management. As at 28th February 2011, it had 50 properties with 285 tenants.  Argosy also manages retail, industrial and commercial buildings. It has the NZD 14.75 million shopping centre and office space Stewart Dawsons in Wellington’s central business district on its books, as well as the NZD 35.25 million Citigroup Centre in Aukland, which is home to Citibank and the US embassy.  The group plans to bring property management in house – instead of contracting out – and believes its shareholders will benefit more from this change than from a takeover by DNZ.  However, Storey said “there is unitholder concern” about the move.  His firm, which has not yet carried out due diligence, wants to buy out Argosy shareholders with its own stock.

Idea is contributing all of its assets, including standalone towers and its 11.2 per cent stake in Indus Towers, equal to 50.0 per cent of the enlarged capital of the company, resulting in a reverse takeover.  Following completion, expected in fiscal 2018, Vodafone will own about 45.1 per cent of the combined firm and will transfer a 4.9 per cent interest to the Aditya Birla Group for INR 39.00 billion in cash.  The latter will then control around 26.0 per cent of the capital, while Idea’s other shareholders will hold the remaining 28.9 per cent.  Together the group will accelerate the pan-India expansion of wireless broadband services using 4G, 4G+ and 5G technologies, support the introduction of digital content and the Internet of Things as well as expand financial inclusion through mobile money services.  Vodafone India has an enterprise value of INR 828.00 billion, while Idea is worth about INR 722.00 billion, representing 6.4 times the former’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), and 6.3 times the latter’s EBITDA of the last 12 months.

The US bidder has quoted an indicative price of INR 6.30 billion (GBP 124.61 million) – valuing the entire company at INR 10.00 billion – this person said.  It is understood the vendor will not meet with any other would-be buyers while in discussions with the private equity group.   As yet Blackstone has no chemicals assets in India, though it is present on the sub-continent through the building firm Nagarjuna Construction, as well as apparel maker Gokaldas Exports.  It already invests in China National Bluestar Group, a Beijing-based chemicals producer which is part of state-owned China National Chemical Corporation.  Dr Gharda, who founded the eponymous company 45 years ago, would not comment when contacted by the ET. He cited a confidentiality clause with four interested parties.  In July Livemint said India’s United Phosphorous is a strong contender to acquire the stock.  Mumbai-based Gharda makes insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. With its products registered for sale on five continents, it is the only Indian company permitted to sell the insecticide Chlorpyrifos and the herbicide Dicamba in the US.

London’s Leander Group, which provides specialist services to contractors, house builders and developers, said it might buy up to 74.4 per cent of Real Office.  Real Office made a GBP 905,000 loss in the year ended 30th April 2008, when it had had assets of GBP 2.491 million.  Leander’s possible offer, which would be paid in cash and shares, could value Real Office at 16 pence per unit and put a price of GBP 2.8 million on its head.  Real Office listed on London’s Alternative Investment Market (Aim) in 2007, raising GBP 4 million.  It has not since made an acquisition, and as such has been unable to reclaim any VAT, so losses for 2008 include GBP 150 million of irrecoverable taxes.   When it announced fiscal 2008 results, Real Office blamed its poor performance on the commercial fit-out industry being “adversely affected by the current economic environment”.  “It has not proved possible for the company to execute the objective strategy for which it was admitted to trading on Aim,” Real Office said.  The group has been reviewing its options for the last six months, and its directors can be expected to unanimously accept Leander’s offer.

       " \"Finland's state-owned oil refining company Neste Oil is considering offloading its tanker company Neste Shipping, according to a report by Finnish business information provider Kauppalehden.  Risto Rinne, the group's president and CEO, is quoted as claiming that ownership of the unit is not vitally important and there are a number of alternatives that the company is exploring.  The most drastic action would be for Neste Oil to sell the shipping company and outsource all of its oil transportation, there is also an option for the company to sell the actual vessels but continue to operate them.  Neste Shipping transports approximately 40 million tonnes of crude oil, oil products and chemicals annually with its largest client being its parent Neste Oil.  Its tonnage consists not only of crude oil, product and chemical tankers but of two barge/pusher combinations and three tugboats as well. The carrying capacity of these tankers varies from 4,000 to 110,000 tonnes.  The unit's operations concentrate mainly on the Baltic, the North Sea and the North Atlantic region.  Neste Shipping saw sales sink 16.8 per cent in 2006 from EUR 352 million to EUR 293 million with operating profits slipping from EUR 87 million to EUR 78 million.  In contrast its parent Neste Oil witnessed a 27.7 per cent increase in sales to EUR 12.734 billion and a 2.8 per cent improvement in operating profit from EUR 831 million to EUR 854 million. Based on these figures the shipping division contributed just 9.1 per cent to its owner's operating profit in 2006, down from 10.5 per cent the previous year.  The unit's net assets were valued at EUR 298 million in 2006, an 8.6 per cent reduction year-on-year with return on net assets falling from 26.7 per cent to 25 per cent.  To ensure maximum safety, Neste only uses tankers with a double hull or a double bottom, and uses escort tugs in the approaches to the company's refineries. With this in mind there is still a possibility that it will decide not to offload the operations, particularly as the unit is undergoing a fleet modernisation programme.  However, it is clear that owning all the vessels in its fleet is not imperative for Neste Oil, what remains important is the ability to guarantee the availability of capacity when it is required.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

Chairman Stein Annexstad said: “The IPO is a natural next step in the company’s development that will help it secure a broader, long-term shareholder base.   “In addition, the listing will enhance BerGenBio’s visibility among potential partners, ensure organised and regulated trading of the shares as well as provide access to the capital markets.”  ABG Sundal Collier, Arctic Securities and DNB Markets are joint bookrunners for the listing on Oslo Børs which has already received the support of the largest stockholder, Meteva, the owner of a 38.4 per cent stake.  The IPO comes almost a year after the researcher of the biology of epithelial-mesenchymal transition tapped existing backers for NOK 212.00 million (USD 25.00 million) by way of a private placement.  Proceeds were earmarked for advance its candidate pipeline, in particular lead asset BGB324, which is an orally available small molecule Axl kinase inhibitor in clinical development in a variety of indications.   This protein is a key driver of cancer spread, immune evasion and drug resistance – the cause of the majority of cancer-related deaths.   BerGenBio noted BGB324 has already provided encouraging clinical data in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myeloid dysplastic syndrome (MDS), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Considering this suggests the candidate may represent a treatment option for patients with these diseases, it should come as no surprise to find the company has entered into a collaboration with Merck.  The agreement comprises an evaluation of BGB324 in combination with the US pharma giant’s pembrolizumab (Keytruda) to tackle NSCLC and triple-negative breast cancer.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Swedish security services business Securitas has bought into Sensormatic Guvenlik Group, one of the leading technical security companies in Turkey.  It has agreed to take a 51.0 per cent interest, which has an enterprise value of SEK 118.00 million (USD 17.64 million), and has the option to acquire the remainder of the company.    Sensormatic provides security systems for customers in the retail, airport, banking, commercial and industrial sectors.   It generates annual sales of TRY 50.00 million (USD 28.07 million) and employs 180 people at offices in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Antalya, Bursa and Gaziantep.  Securitas claims to be the number one security company in Turkey, where it has a 9,500-strong staff.  “This acquisition is in line with Securitas strategy to complement specialised physical security solutions with technical security solutions,” the buyer said.   “Securitas and Sensormatic will continue their development in Turkey based on their strong customer base and on top will benefit from working together approaching the market with new security solutions,” it added.  The Swedish firm is adding to a pool of 2011 acquisitions which target growing security markets. In January it bought 85.0 per cent of Bosnia and Herzegovina-based Adria Ipon Security and kept the option to take full control of the business.   Four months later it took over Argentina-based Consultora Videco, while other 2011 purchases include 85.0 per cent of Croatia’s Zvonimir Security and 50.0 per cent plus one share in Jordan-based Al Sharika Al Muatfawika Likhadamat Al Amin Wa Al Himaya.  Securitas was planning to buy surveillance technology firm Niscayah Group, which is based in its domestic market, but withdrew an offer earlier this month.  The group has a presence on six continents and employs 295,000 people in 49 countries. Its main services are guarding, mobile security, monitoring and consulting, and investigation.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'London-listed DCC is continuing to build up a substantial European retail petrol station business, this time through the acquisition of Esso Norge’s network in Norway for NOK 2.43 billion (GBP 235.00 million).   The deal for the division, which is substantially asset backed, should generate a return on invested capital employed of about 15.0 per cent in the first full year following closing in the final calendar quarter 2017.  Esso’s retail business is touted as the third-largest in Norway with about 20.0 per cent of retail volumes and comprises 142 company-operated sites – 127 service and 15 unmanned stations – and has contracts to supply 108 Esso-branded dealer-owned locations.  It sells roughly 600 million litres of fuel annually and, though the network is spread across the country, the majority of the assets can be found in the more populous southern regions.  NorgesGruppen, the largest grocery retailer and wholesaler in Norway, has operated the convenience store element of the company-managed sites under a long-term contract since December 2015.  DCC, which has entered into long-term brand and supply agreements with Esso, intends to merge the network into DCC Energy’s existing retail information technology and operating infrastructure.  The Irish sales, marketing and business support services group noted its own assets were developed during 2015 as a way of taking on Esso France’s activities and easing the way for a hub and spoke operating model.  Basically, DCC can manage key pricing, supply and back office functions remotely from a centre near Dublin and in conjunction with local teams.  The company will run about 1,000 petrol stations across Europe and supply some 2,000 dealer-owned locations following the acquisition.  According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, the purchase is on course to be one of the largest deals by value targeting a Norwegian petrol station operator on record.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " \"Shares in Singapore-based shipping services firm Labroy Marine gained 5 per cent in Thursday trading on news Dubai Drydocks World (DD World) might make a bid.  According to the Business Times, it would make sense for DD World, an affiliate of the UAE investment company Dubai World, to acquire Labroy as a bolt-on to its recent purchase of Pan-United Marine.   The newspaper also claimed Labroy founder and chairman Tan Boy Tee has expressed an interest in selling his controlling stake in the firm.  Labroy saw its shares rise to a close of SGD 2.74 after the report, giving it an equity value of SGD 2.273 billion (GBP 758.825 million).  With its main businesses in shipbuilding, repair, offshore rig construction and shipping, Labroy is primarily concerned with marine construction and engineering, while it launched the rig building business in fiscal 2006.  It has two full-service shipyards in Indonesia and a diversified fleet of 185 vessels from which its subsidiary Labroy Marine provides ocean towage, dry cargo transportation and vessel charter services.  If the Business Times report proves to be true, it is likely to be this part of the business, which has quadrupled its fleet size since 1991, that DD World is eyeing.  The UAE-based firm agreed to acquire Singapore's Pan-United in May for SGD 647.874 million in an acquisition that brought shipbuilding and repair expertise, but did not have the logistics or rig building offerings of Labroy.  Having demonstrated the ability to restructure its business successfully into new markets, Labroy has sound fundamentals and has consistent revenue streams (FY 2006: SGD 625.689 million; FY 2005: SGD 515.751 million; FY 2004: SGD 368.145 million; FY 2003: SGD 241.501 million).  With margins kept above 10 per cent during this time, the group has also seen steady growth at the bottom line, with net earnings growing at an even pace (FY 2006: SGD 73.803 million; FY 2005: SGD 53.891 million; FY 2004: SGD 42.271 million; FY 2003: SGD 25.424 million).  Cash positive at SGD 5.765 million last year, Labroy has an attractive cashflow, while its gearing was down at its lowest point in recent memory at 8.23 per cent from this decade's high of 90.9 per cent in 2002.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

The purchase price comprises CNY 37.43 million in cash and shares and CNY 12.57 million in incentive stock compensation for staff over a three-year period.   ATA initially entered a framework agreement that included a six-month period of exclusive negotiations back in March this year, to determine whether to acquire the target’s shares.   Beijing Biztour is one of China’s largest operators of educational tours, and has over 7,000 students through its business-to-business network.  It has overseas learning programmes in more than 30 international locations, with over 300 tour products across 15 categories, which include subjects such as art, mathematics and languages, as well as outdoor activities.  Beijing Biztour has a vast global network of partners, which features 200 education camps, connections with top US universities such as Harvard and Stanford, and a further 300 part-time members and 1,100 host families worldwide.  Jack Huang, president of ATA, said: “[We] Look forward to working closely with management on growing the business and pursuing prospects for expansion and diversification by leveraging ATA's expertise in learning technologies and industry relationships, as well as the synergies between our operational capabilities, resources and competencies.”  A deal reflects the growing need from urban families in China to receive a more diverse and international education.  The Ministry of Education reported that in 2016, 544,500 Chinese students studied abroad, more than triple 179,800 who did so in 2008, confirming China as the main source of international students in the world.  As a result of the deal, Beijing Biztour will be able to expand its product nationally, as well as increasing its presence in the education sector worldwide.   © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

Sources told Reuters a deal is expected to close by the end of the first quarter.  The move by Bharti is said to be an attempt to strengthen itself against market competition, namely Kenya-based mobile network operator Safaricom.  A deal would also improve the valuation of the buyer’s UK subsidiary Airtel Africa ahead of its planned initial public offering, expected between May and June this year, the Economic Times stated.   Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, shows there were 791 deals targeting wired and wireless telecommunications carriers announced worldwide in 2018.  T-Mobile headed the list, agreeing to buy Sprint for USD 59.00 billion.   Other companies targeted in this sector last year include Altice USA, TCD, TPG Telecom, Get and Ufinet Telecom.  The target, which is 60.0 per cent owned by Helios Investment and 40.0 per cent owned by the government of Kenya, previously broached the possibility of a merger with Airtel’s Kenyan unit, before plans fell through in June last year.   Sources close to the matter however told Reuters that the Telkom is leading the negotiations and will decide the outcome of the talks.   That said, the company did not respond to requests to comment on the discussions.  Established in 1999, Telekom specialises telecommunications services to small and medium-sized business, as well as account management for government clients.  It has a presence within 47 counties and provides wholesale, carrier-to-carrier traffic through its fibre optic infrastructure to the country and the East African region.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, although the group paid USD 150.00 million for its initial interest back in 2015.  Panasonic, best known for its leading electronics products, expects the transaction to close by the end of April, subject to approvals from European authorities and other relevant bodies.  The company is looking to reach sales of JPY 2,000 billion (EUR 16.51 billion) for its automotive business by fiscal 2019 and is therefore exploring initiatives to target growth in the market.  Ficosa, which posted sales of EUR 1.11 billion in the year ended 31st December 2015, is expected to help Panasonic achieve its goals, while boosting the commercialisation of products jointly developed by both companies.  However, the deal is not expected to have any material effect on the forecast consolidated financial results of the buyer for the year ended 31st March 2017.  Barcelona-headquartered Ficosa is mainly focused on rear-view systems, such as interior and side mirrors, and is known worldwide for its global original equipment manufacturing services.  The group has operations in Europe and North and South America across a total of 17 countries with around 10,280 employees.  Panasonic will pick up the 20.0 per cent interest from Ficosa Inversion, currently the target’s largest shareholder, which will see its stake reduced to 31.0 per cent.  The move comes as other electronic giants make a move into the automotive industry, including Samsung Electronics’ USD 8.00 billion acquisition of Harman International Industries in November.   2016 was a significant year for Ficosa as it posted a new record in terms of contracts for rear-view mirrors. The annual value of such agreements was up 30.0 per cent year-on-year to an all-time high of 27.30 million units to be produced in 2021 at EUR 1.00 billion.  In 2014, Reuters cited sources close to the matter as saying Panasonic was interested in increasing its stake in Ficosa to around 50.0 per cent for a potential JPY 30.00 billion.

The broadcaster has agreed to sell the holding, which it owns through its commercial arm BBC Worldwide, and has already received approval from the BBC Trust.  Under the terms of the transaction, NC2 Media will cough up AUD 75.00 million (USD 77.81 million) for the Melbourne-headquartered business, of which AUD 60.00 million will be paid on completion, with the remaining AUD 15.00 million to follow in one year.  Daniel Houghton, executive director of the acquiror, has high hopes for the deal’s effect on the firm’s footprint, saying the company will be able to establish a global presence in the travel guide sector, as well as in magazine publishing and the digital industry.  Lonely Planet was established in 1973 by husband and wife Tony and Maureen Wheeler, putting out its first guide when the two decided to cross Europe and Asia overland to Australia for their honeymoon.  It now claims to be the world’s most successful travel publisher, with more than 100.00 million books printed in nine different languages.  The BBC bought a 75.0 per cent share of the business in October 2007 for an undisclosed fee, and subsequently upped its holding to 100.0 per cent for AUD 67.00 million in February 2011.  However, the broadcaster decided to divest Lonely Planet following last year’s commercial review when it resolved to concentrate on its own brands while promoting its best content on a global scale.  As such, it has been keeping its eyes open for a buyer for around a year, hoping it could find a business capable of bringing greater focus and capital to the target.  Its chief executive Paul Dempsey said NC2 Media is better placed to build the company going forward.  Completion of the acquisition is expected to occur by 31st March.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Yunfeng Capital and (sponsors) have set up special purpose investment vehicle IK Healthcare to carry out the acquisition set at a price of USD 20.60 per American depository share (ADS) or USD 41.20 per class A stock.  News that private equity firm founded by Jack Ma and David Feng was once again attempting a public takeover, following a bidding war in 2016, emerged a little over two weeks ago.  The offer represents a 15.0 per cent premium to USD 17.92 on 9th March, the last unaffected close prior to the announcement on the 12th, and of 24.7 per cent and 28.5 per cent to the 30- and 60-day volume-weighted average.  IK Healthcare is funding the acquisition through USD 1.15 billion in cash by the sponsors and a rollover financing of ADSs – or a 25.6 per cent stake - held by chairman Lee Ligang Zhang and vice-chairman Boquan He.  The deal comes several years after iKang was the subject of a bidding war between private equity-backed suitors, one led by management and the other by arch-rival Meinian Onehealth Healthcare.  Yunfeng entered the fray in 2016 with its own offer, just as a poison pill tactic by the healthcare company forced the competitor to drop its unfriendly approach.  iKang had 110 self-owned centres across 33 of China’s most affluent cities, such as Shanghai, Changzhou and Wuhan, as of 22nd March 2018, and has extended its coverage to a further 200 by contracting with over 400 third-party facilities.

It is understood that a proposal has been submitted to Malaysia’s economic planning unit but Bidin’s name is not on the documents; it is market speculation linking him to the offer, the report said.  Plus’s shares were virtually unmoved today on the news, advancing just 0.3 per cent to their intra-day high of MYR 3.27 (GBP 0.56). They have lost 0.6 per cent of their value since the start of August.

Kuala Lumpur-based Plus is 64.0 per cent owned by Singapore’s United Engineers Group, the construction company controlled by Khazanah Nasional. At present market prices this shareholding can be valued at MYR 10.43 billion.  The Business Times described Plus as the jewel in United Engineers’ crown.

One of the sources mentioned to Reuters: \"They are out in the market looking to sell on a full portfolio basis: They are prepared to divide it into sub-portfolios, but they are looking to sell the whole operation.”  The three people familiar with the matter also mentioned that American Capital has started sounding out potential buyers; it has approached secondary firms but believes parts of its portfolio may pique the interest of private equity houses.  American Capital has mandated Citigroup to advise it on the process, Reuters said, citing its sources.  Founded in 2005 and registered in the tax haven of Guernsey, European Capital is a publicly traded investment company for pan-European equity, mezzanine and senior debt investments with capital resources of around EUR 2.70 billion (USD 3.57 billion).  The group is managed by European Capital Financial Services (Guernsey), a subsidiary of a wholly-owned portfolio company of American Capital.   It invests in and sponsors management and employee buyouts, backs private equity buyouts and provides capital directly to private and public companies headquartered predominantly in Europe.

Standard Chartered Bank, CIMB Bank and HSBC are just some of those handling the IPO, the WSJ said, citing sources.  These people noted around half the offering has been snapped up by institutional buyers who have committed to act as cornerstone investors and the REIT may offer to pay a dividend of as much as 9.0 per cent, which may further add to the appeal of the flotation.  Back in July, Reuters reported the trust was gearing up for a listing in which it expected to raise USD 400.00 million.  WSJ observed that Viva’s initial portfolio – 78.0 per cent of which is allocated to be business park property – is expected to include UE BizHub East, a development incorporating two industrial buildings, a 251-room hotel and a convention centre.  In July the trust agreed to buy the project from United Engineers in exchange for the right to subscribe for 5.0 per cent of stapled securities to be sold by the trust in its planned IPO, as well as almost USD 90.00 million in net gains.

Yesterday, staff confirmed that an offer for the sale of Bury FC has been tabled and is believed to be a good deal.   They added that Dale has been informed of the bid, believed to be the only lifeline left for the future of the team; they are waiting to hear back from the owner and are urging him to accept the proposal.   Shortly following the statement, the businessman, who bought Bury FC in December last year, spoke to BBC Radio Manchester, saying he is happy to pass the club onto the next custodian for an agreed consideration and if they are the right fit for the team.   The side is yet to play a game this season after League One matches against MK Dons and Accrington, as well as today’s planned match against Sheffield Wednesday, have all been suspended.   In addition, the upcoming game against Gillingham, due on 17th August, is also in question as if Bury FC cannot provide the required financing plans today, this match will also be suspended.   According to the BBC, EFL executive chair Debbie Jevans has said: “We remain disappointed that we are still not in a position to reach a successful conclusion with Mr Dale, but will continue to work diligently in an effort to receive the information we require.”   The club has until 23rd August to resolve the issue or risk being expelled from the league; however, within hours of being set this deadline, Bury FC said it has received a takeover offer.

Arbuthnot chairman Henry Angest pointed out that the retail bank did not need support during the financial crisis, even growing at a time when other financial institutions were struggling.   Angest descried the sector’s “challenges, distractions and legacy issues” as a “significant opportunity [. . .] to grow within its chosen markets”.  STB chief executive Paul Lynam said his bank had managed to almost double net lending and increase its customer base by 47.0 per cent in the year to 30th Jun 2011.  Shares in the target are expected to be admitted to trading by the end of this month.   West Midlands-based STB offers current accounts with a monthly management fee and the potential to earn rewards by shopping at certain retail partners. Customers are issued with a prepaid MasterCard rather than a debit card.  The company’s website claims its services are suitable for a wide range of users, such as students, people with poor credit histories and those who want to donate their rewards to charity.   STB also provides a range of savings accounts and bonds.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'New Silk Route (NSR) is on course to making a return of more than three times its original investment in Indian private school and junior college operator Sri Chaitanya Educational Institutions (SCEG), the Economic Times (ET) reported.  Four sources with knowledge of the matter told the newspaper the Asia-focused private equity fund has hired Morgan Stanley to begin sounding out interest in the academic services provider.  It is believed the advisor has already initiated discussions with some of NSR’s rivals, including TPG Capital, Barings Asia, General Atlantic, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Apax Partners.  A deal involving SCEG is likely to consist of a sale of new shares and the private equity fund’s 25.0 per cent stake, which together could be valued at INR 18.00 billion (USD 300.00 million).  Proceeds from the primary stock offering would be used to expand the company’s network, some of the sources told the ET.   SCEG was founded in 1986 by Boppana Satyanarayana Rao and his wife Jhansi Lakshmi Bai as a junior colleges operator before spreading its wings to include school education in 2008.  According to the Indian Credit Rating Agency, the group’s trusts operate the facilities while management companies provide the education services to these pedagogical institutions.   SCEG’s trusts comprise Sri Chaitanya Educational Committee, Sri Kalyana Chakravarti Memorial Educational Trust, Sri Chaitanya Educational Trust (SCET) and Nexgen Educational Trust.  Management entities consist of Varsity Education Management, Junior Varsity Education Management and K-12 Education Management.   SCET, in alliance with Nexgen, operate under the SCEG banner in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka and, together, had 140,000 students enrolled at 196 schools in 2013.  According to the Indian Credit Rating Agency’s August 2013 statement, the company generated net profit of INR 906.00 million on revenue of INR 13.30 billion in fiscal 2013, compared to INR 1.24 billion on turnover of INR 10.26 billion in FY 2012.  NSR bought into SCEG in 2011 for USD 25.00 million and its investment is now valued at USD 100.00 million, the ET reported.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Polish broadcaster Telewizja Puls is considering the possibility of an initial public offering (IPO) to raise cash to support growth and increase market share, according to its chief executive and owner.  Dariusz Dabski told Reuters the company is planning to float on the Warsaw exchange around the end of this year.  TV Puls currently operates two channels and achieved a 6.0 per cent share of the Polish market last month.  It is now looking to build on this growth by making more of its own programmes and developing its online presence.   Dabski told Reuters he wants to reach 7.0 per cent market share in order to challenge the dominance of rivals Cyfrowy Polsat and TVN VN and feels the best way to do this would be to become a publicly-traded company.  He said an IPO would likely be in the tens of millions of zlotys rather than the hundreds.  “If, however, there is suddenly a possibility of an interesting takeover, which will give us turbo power, it will be hundreds (of millions)”, he remarked.  TV Puls is a commercial channel that was launched by the Franciscan Order in March 2001.   After running into financial difficulties in 2003 the station went off the air but was later resurrected by private firm Antena 1 and Zygmunt Solorz-Zak, owner of Polsat.  Until recently, a large proportion of TV Puls’ content was devoted to Catholic issues, reflecting its roots in the Franciscan Order.   In 2007 Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation bought a 35.0 per cent stake in the company and set about a major rebranding exercise, with a new logo and more mainstream programming.   The following year News Corp sold its interest back to the Order and Dabski after a new information programme launched as part of the overhaul was pulled due to poor ratings and high production costs.    Dabski bought out the friars in 2010 to become sole owner of TV Puls.  Last week Reuters reported that Poland’s biggest website wp.pl is preparing for an IPO in Warsaw in the next few months that could raise around PLN 300.00 million (EUR 72.25 million).   © Zephus Ltd',\n",

       " 'Phillips 66, a US-based energy manufacturing and logistics company, is in advanced stage negotiations to divest the Whitegate oil refinery, which is the sole processing plant in Ireland, the Irish Examiner reported.  Without citing sources, the newspaper noted a sale could be announced as soon as next week.  Phillips 66 is in talks with potential bidders, which may include private equity firm ArcLight Capital, Canada-based Irving Oil, UK-headquartered PTFPlusOne and Valero Energy, according to the Irish Examiner.  The paper observed that Irving Oil is currently in the lead to pick up the Whitegate refinery, which produces around 71,000 barrels of oil per day.  Phillips 66 has made various attempts to sell the Irish plant, which has been on the market since November 2015 after the group decided to once again seek a buyer after it failed to divest the unit in 2014.  Unfortunately the future of Whitegate’s 157 plus staff is unclear as a buyer could opt to keep the facility open or close it and use it for storage, a second report by Reuters noted.  The Irish Examiner cited Sean Kelly, Fine Gael member of European Parliament, last month as cautioning the importance of the refiner is crucial to Ireland’s fuel security, which could be made more risky if the UK should opt to leave the EU.  He reportedly added that with Whitegate up for sale there is a cause for concern given the question marks about the country’s petrol, gasoil and diesel supply.  The Cork-located refinery mainly produces transportation and heating fuels sourced primarily from the North Sea and West Africa.  According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, there have been 11 deals targeting Western European petroleum refineries announced so far in 2016.  The largest of these involved Turkey-based Socar Turkey Enerji buying a minority stake in Petkim Petrokimya Holding for TRY 146.54 million (USD 49.16 million) in March.  Seven of these deals took the form of investments in Italian oil and gas group Saras, while Kuwait Petroleum Europoort and Royal Dutch Shell’s refining assets in Germany were also targeted.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The bid from the Kassel-based crude oil and natural gas producer will value Stavanger-based Revus at a 145.0 per cent premium to Friday’s closing price.  Shares rose 104.9 per cent from NOK 44.90 on 24th October to close at NOK 92.00 on 27th October after trading at a high of NOK 100 in the day.  The NOK 5,039.10 million offer would be made through wholly-owned subsidiary Wintershall Norwegen Explorations-und Produktions.  Wintershall Holding is itself part of BASF and the acquisition of the Norwegian group will be “an excellent strategic fit” and will give the company “growth potential in its core region”.  Chief executive officer of Revus, Harald Vabø, approves of the bid: “The acquisition combines Wintershall’s North Sea offshore expertise with Revus‘s excellent understanding and proven track record on the Norwegian and UK continental shelves with significant potential for further organic growth and investment opportunities in Norway.”  The group has retained JPMorgan, JPMorgan Cazenove and First Securities as financial advisors.  It is a relatively young company, established in December 2002 by Tim Sullivan, Harald Vabø, Svein Ilebekk and Walter Sognnes.  Total assets stood at NOK 2.65 billion at the year ended December 2007. Operating turnover increased 156.0 per cent year-on-year (FY 2006: NOK 296.22 million; FY 2007: NOK 758.43 million).  A loss before tax of NOK 163.55 million in fiscal 2006 was turned into a profit of NOK 51.85 million in 2007.   Similarly, net income fared the same; a profit of NOK 356.28 million was made in 2007 compared to a loss of NOK 41.12 million the previous fiscal year.  In the interim report for Q2 2008 Revus reported a net profit of NOK 49.60 million, a contrast to a loss of NOK 7.50 million in Q2 2007.  Operating turnover for the quarter was NOK 172.9 million, a positive result from the loss of the previous year (Q2 2007: NOK 21.6 million).

Lookers closed at 84.75 pence yesterday and the Telegraph linked the increase to talk that the group's management may launch a bid.  In the meantime, the Independent was unsure of the possible bidder but suggested that an offer of 110 pence was on the cards, which would value the retailer's equity at just under GBP 200 million.  At the end of last month, Tony Bramall, a non-executive director at the retailer, took his stake in the firm to 22.3 per cent.  Bramall has periodically increased his ownership of Lookers over the last year, purchasing the shares at between 90 pence and 109.3 pence, and the group is currently trading close to its 52-week low of 74.5 pence.  During fiscal 2007, turnover was up 17.8 per cent to GBP 1.68 billion (FY 2006: GBP 1.427 billion) and operating profit climbed 20.81 per cent to GBP 38.3 million.

       " \"Shares in Papa John’s International finished 8.2 per cent higher in extended trading yesterday after the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported an activist hedge fund has opened up lines of communication with the pizza chain.  According to the newspaper, Trian Fund Management, which has a minority stake in Wendy’s, is asking for information on which it could base a potential bid, though the suitor is merely one of several restaurant and buyout firms interested in the business.  Should the activist investor table an offer, it may buy and operate the chain separately or could acquire the takeout and delivery services provider through the aforementioned burger group.  The WSJ added Trian has three seats on the board of Wendy’s, as well as a 13.0 per cent stake, and is “best known for working with the management of struggling companies”.   Earlier this year, in June to be exact, the fund’s co-founder asked Papa John’s John Schnatter whether he would meet and talk with executives of the burger chain, though the newspaper could not provide any further information on the matter.  Trian is by no means the only activist investor drawn to the chain, after all, at the beginning of October. Legion Partners Asset Management and the California State Teachers' Retirement System announced they jointly held a 5.5 per cent stake.   In the disclosure filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the two said the current market price (USD 1.59 billion capitalisation at the time of writing) does not reflect intrinsic value.  While they are encouraged by the way the special committee has worked on moving past recent controversies, they also believe “multiple potential paths to significantly higher valuations exist” through “strategic partnerships or improving operations as a stand-alone company”.  They “believe that meaningfully higher earnings power than the company has demonstrated historically is attainable through a combination of cost efficiencies and refranchising of company owned operations”.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

Sources with knowledge of the situation told the news provider the private equity group has hired Citigroup and EFG-Hermes Holding for the process that comes amid an increase in demand for services in Africa and the Middle East.  The people added the portfolio company is valued at roughly USD 500.00 million, and a listing or sale could happen during the first half of the year, though the investor may yet decide to keep the business.  Abraaj’s focus on healthcare has included clinics and related activities, and has comprised investment in the likes of IDH, billed as the leading chain of diagnostic labs in Egypt, and Turkish hospital operator Acibadem.  The company has already made a return on Cleopatra Hospital by selling a stake through a listing on the Egyptian stock exchange in 2016, which came on the heels of the IPO of Unimed on the Tunis exchange.  Abraaj invested in its first hospital in Egypt in 2014 and, through a series of acquisitions, established the largest integrated network in the country, according to its website.  The group exited IDH via an IPO on the London Stock Exchange and sold its entire 50.0 per cent stake in Acibadem to Integrated Healthcare (IHH) and Khazanah Nasional in 2011.  It then cashed in on its investment in IHH by listing the Malaysian company domestically.

Zia Ahmed, chairman of the Bangladesh Telecoms Regulatory Commission (BTRC), told reporters that Bharti Airtel has applied for permission to acquire the stock.  The Indian telecoms group had previously been trying to merge with MTN Group of South Africa and is eager for rapid international expansion.  “Bharti has been looking for an overseas company for quite some time,” Hitesh Agrawal, an analyst at Angel Broking, told Bloomberg.  Agrawal noted growth is slowing in India: “The quality of new subscribers is in doubt as average revenue per user is falling.”   Warid has been operating in its domestic market for two years and had built its network to cover 61 districts and serve 2.00 million people by the end of its first year of business. It has extended into Pakistan and plans to move to Uganda and Congo.   Ahmed would not suggest how much 70.0 per cent of the company might be worth, though he is cited by India’s Economic Times (ET) as saying Bharti “initially intended to invest USD 300.00 million”.  The paper also quoted a source at Warid, who said the company would command “premium valuations” because it operates in high-growth markets.  Its BTRC licence follows a USD 1.00 billion agreement between Abu Dhabi and Bangladesh, of which USD 750.00 million was intended as direct investment in the latter’s telecoms industry.  Abu Dhabi, under the pressure of burgeoning debt, will remain a significant minority investor, the ET’s Warid source noted.

       " 'Honworld Group has hired Macquarie as bookrunner and lead manager for  an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong which values the mainland cooking wine producer at as much as HKD 3.58 billion (USD 461.67 million).  The Cayman Islands-incorporated listing hopeful is putting a quarter of its enlarged equity capital on the block to potentially raise up to HKD 893.75 million by selling 125.00 million stocks at a price between HKD 4.95 and HKD 7.15.  Honworld is already safe in the knowledge it has secured a cornerstone investor in the form of CIG Trustees, which has agreed to acquire a 2.6 per cent stake for roughly USD 10.00 million – based on the mid-point of the offer price.  The Hong Kong-incorporated trust business is ultimately controlled by state-owned financial and insurance group China Taiping Insurance, which has a presence domestically and in Europe, Oceania, East and Southeast Asia.  Honworld claims to be the largest manufacturer of cooking wine in China, with a market share of 13.8 per cent in terms of retail sales value and 5.8 per cent by volume in 2012.  Products are made under the Lao Heng He brand, though the group also offers other condiments such as soy sauce and vinegar, all of which are distributed via a network of 200 wholesalers covering 30 provinces.  Honworld’s top line has significantly grown over the last three financial years ended 31st December and sales amounted to CNY 337.13 million (USD 55.32 million) in FY 2012 (FY 2011: CNY 109.49 million; FY 2010: CNY 32.54 million).  Similarly, net profit has increased from CNY 6.28 million in FY 2010 to CNY 98.44 million in FY and in the eight months ended 31st August 2013 the group booked net profit of CNY 29.70 million on revenue of CNY 322.86 million.  According to the prospectus, the Chinese cooking wine market, in terms of retail sales value, rose by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.4 per cent from 2008 to 2012.  The segment is expected to increase by a CAGR of 20.3 per cent from 2012 to 2017 to reach CNY 10.60 billion.   It should not be too surprising to find out that Honworld intends to use IPO proceeds to expand its manufacturing facilities in order to maintain a leading presence.  Money will also be used to buy rice for the production of base wine and ramp up the group’s distribution network, among other things.  Honworld had net debt of CNY 304.57 million and a gearing ratio of 116.5 per cent as at 31st August 2013.  When asked by the Standard about the company’s highly financially leveraged position, non-executive director Zhang Bihong said the group had borrowed to buy raw materials and build a manufacturing base.

       " 'German steelmaking powerhouse ThyssenKrupp has roped in Deutsche Bank to seek buyers for its high-performance alloy unit VDM in a fresh attempt to cut itself loose from the ill-starred venture, two people privy to the matter told Reuters.  The sale process is not likely to get underway until a further reshuffle has been 1 at the subsidiary, and the Essen-based parent may even decide to hang on to the asset if prices remain substantially below book value, these sources added.  VDM expects to post earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of between EUR 60.00 million and EUR 70.00 million this year and could be worth more than EUR 500.00 million in a sale, they noted.  ThyssenKrupp sold the business, which was previously housed within the group’s stainless steel subsidiary Inoxum, to Outokumpu for EUR 2.70 billion in 2012.  However, the weight of this financial outlay proved too great for the Finnish group and it came close to bankruptcy.  Within a year it was forced to sell the Terni and VDM assets back to the German group in a bid to shore up its balance sheet.  Outokumpu unloaded the two units to Thyssenkrupp in exchange for a loan note worth EUR 1.27 billion at the end of September 2013.  The German group then sold its stake in, and severed all financial ties with, the Espoo-based steelmaker, which is still struggling to get back on an even keel after announcing yesterday it expects operating losses to widen in the third quarter due to slack summer sales in Europe.  Thyssenkrupp has since been weighing options for VDM, and one of the sources told Reuters that bidders which previously expressed interest in the unit under Outokumpu’s ownership may return with new bids.  These include private equity houses Lindsay Goldberg, KPS Capital, Triton, Pamplona and Advent, while stainless steelmaker Aperam and Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, who made an attempt to take over Swiss group Schmolz + Bickenbach last year.

Hony bought the popular casual dining chain for GBP 900.00 million from Cinven in 2014.

It had operating profit of NZD 692.59 million, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of NZD 40.40 million and net profit of NZD 0.56 million in the 12 months to the end of July 2018.  Westland sells products - such as milk powder, butter, protein powder, high-temperature sterilisation equipment and infant formula base powder - to more than 40 countries.  When taking into account the company’s presence in the Chinese market and its position in New Zealand’s raw milk supply market, among other things, its corporate value is about NZD 588.00 million.  Yili views Westland as a way to increase its competitiveness by acquiring a share in an established stable market, to expand overseas and to improve its brand influence, which will help consolidate its overall presence in the dairy sector.  The group is the largest dairy producer in China - with an estimated 22.0 per cent share - and Asia and has a strategy to grow both its domestic and global businesses.   It acquired Oceania Dairy in 2013 and since that time it has invested CNY 3.00 billion (about USD 446.72 million) in establishing milk powder, infant formula and UHT production lines for Oceania.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'US gas distributor Sempra Energy has revealed that its Mexican division is opening up its equity base to new investors by way of an initial public offering (IPO) and a private placement with institutional investors.  The Californian Fortune 500 power provider announced yesterday the business south of the border has already filed applications with Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores and the local bourse to list domestically.  It is putting between 15.0 and 20.0 per cent stake on the block in order to raise money for general corporate purpose, including funding current investments and ongoing expansion plans.  As details are thin on the ground, it is not known whether the IPO will be a spin-off of assets into a new company or some other corporate structure.  David Shields, a Mexico City-based independent energy analyst and publisher of Energia magazine, told Bloomberg that Sempra has been betting on Mexico for many years.  Shields noted the share sale is the latest sign the company views the country as a destination for gas distribution as well as a funding source.  Sempra is a San Diego-based energy services holding company with 2011 revenues of USD 10.00 billion and nearly 17,000 employees serving more than 31.00 million consumers worldwide.  The group’s international division develops, constructs and operates infrastructure assets and distributes electricity and natural gas to customers in Mexico, Chile, Peru and Argentina.   It also builds and operates electricity generation facilities and liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals.  The company’s international business is comprised of two new reporting segments: Sempra South American Utilities and Sempra Mexico, which operates 436.00 miles of pipelines in all of the six domestic states along the border.  Sempra Mexico recorded third-quarter earnings of USD 54.00 million in 2012, up from USD 47.00 million in 2011, mainly due to an improved operating performance.  For the first nine months of 2012, this segment had earnings of USD 134.00 million, accounting for 23.7 per cent of Sempra’s total profit of USD 566.00 million for the period.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Under the agreement, the final details of which were not disclosed, the two will work to reinvent the loss-making niche brand as a leader in the premium electric vehicles (EV) market.  A new generation of smart green models will be assembled at a purpose-built EV factory in China with global sales due to begin in 2022.  As part of the vehicle-development programme, the partners will work on extending the product portfolio into the fast-growing B-segment.  The board of directors of the new 50:50 joint venture will be made up of six executives with equal representation from both parties.  Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz division has produced EVs at a site in Hambach for more than a decade: in 2007 smart launched a battery-powered car and has been making electrified smarts in series since 2012.   The facility is currently churning out two other green models, namely, the smart EQ fortwo coupé and the smart EQ fortwo cabrio.  Daimler will continue to produce these at Hambach up until 2022, when design and manufacturing will move to China, after which, the plant will house a new line of compact EVs by Mercedes-Benz.  The smart brand sold a total of?130,000 vehicles in 40 markets worldwide in 2018 (2017:?135,500).  News of the tie-up came as the Chinese government slashed subsidies further for EVs ahead of removing them entirely by 2020.  Homegrown players will need to step up to the plate to gain traction in the market as the country is also preparing to lift restrictions on foreign car makers seeking to invest in the local new energy car sector.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

They added that these potential acquirors have reached the second round of the process, but said a number of trade buyers have also expressed an interest.

Closing remains subject to the green light from regulatory bodies, among other customary closing conditions, and is expected to follow in around 45 days’ time.  Commenting on the acquisition, Idex chief executive Andy Silvernail stated: “AWG brings excellent brands and products to our expanding Fire Suppression platform.   “This addition, coupled with our recent acquisition of Akron Brass, further supports our global customers with best in class life safety and fire suppression solutions.”  Idex paid USD 224.20 million in cash to pick up Ohio-headquartered safety and emergency response equipment manufacturer Akron Brass on a debt and cash free basis from Premier Farnell back in March.  The company’s previous targets have included Connecticut-based microfluidic components maker CIDRA Precision Services, Italian valve products manufacturer Alfa Valvole and Novotema, a producer of rubber seals which is also located in Italy.  AWG Fittings claims to be one of the leading manufacturers of mobile and stationary fire protection systems worldwide.  Its output includes fire-fighting fittings, fire protection systems and hydraulic rescue equipment, which is supplied under brands such as Lancier Rescue Systems, Alco and AWG.

It\\'s still in the process of being studied, and whether it will go through depends on many factors,\" Wilai added. He gave no timeframe for the study.  The assets being targeted are operated by a Thai venture – known as Hutchison CAT Wireless Multimedia (Hutch-CAT) – which was established by Hong Kong-registered Hutchison Whampoa and Thailand’s CAT Telecom Thailand.  Set up in 2002, it was the first telecoms operator in its domestic market to provide 3G services using CDMA technology and now has a small share under the Hutch brand.  There has been talk of state-backed CAT buying Hutchison’s 74.0 per cent stake in the Bangkok-based venture since 2008.  Earlier this month the Bangkok Post said the Thai partner has been trying to buy Hutch-CAT for THB 7.50 billion (USD 252.62 million), thereby getting the latter’s network in 25 central Thai provinces.  CAT wants to combine its own CDMA network with that of the target company so it can offer a single nationwide network, the Bangkok Post observed.   Problems have arisen in that Thailand’s state enterprise policy office believes the assets are only worth THB 4.00 billion – and Hutchison will not sell for less than THB 6.57 billion.  The paper suggested AIS and True Move, Thailand’s number one and number three mobile operators, respectively, are both interested in taking over Hutch-CAT.   Citing an industry source who was not named, it said True Move is already in talks with Hutchison regarding the deal.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Canadian film distributor and television producer Entertainment One has said it has rejected a potential takeover bid for the company on the grounds that it was too low.  The firm issued a statement on the London Stock Exchange saying the approach fundamentally undervalues the business and its prospects.  According to the release, the preliminary offer was for GBP 2.36 per share, thereby valuing Entertainment One at over GBP 1.00 billion.  The target issued the statement as a result of fluctuations in its share price, which closed up 9.6 per cent at 2.17 on 9th August, the last trading day prior to the approach being announced.  As such, the bid represents a 19.2 per cent premium over Entertainment One’s close of GBP 1.98 on 8th August, before the share price increase.  It did not reveal the suitor’s identity, but Reuters cited a source as saying UK broadcaster ITV was the source of the bid.  The news provider noted that the firm has been on the acquisition trail in the production sector of late in a bid to reduce its dependence on broadcast advertising revenues in the UK.  Entertainment One was first named as a potential takeover target back in June 2015 and in April 2016 people in the know told Bloomberg that ITV was interested in the company.  The BBC also picked up on the latest news and cited Neil Wilson, a market analyst at ETX Capital, as saying the UK broadcaster could decide to increase its offer price in the wake of the rejection of its initial approach.

       " 'Smartgroup is planning to lodge a prospectus with regulators at the beginning of next week for an initial public offering which could fetch up to AUD 170.00 million (USD 159.14 million), the Business Spectator’s DataRoom column reported.  The Australian newspaper picked up the subscription-only report which said the Australian owner of salary packaging services provider Smartsalary intends to kick off a bookbuilding process this week on the back of interest from potential investors.  According to the publication, the float could be worth between AUD 150.00 million and AUD 170.00 million based on a price range of AUD 1.55 to AUD 1.75 apiece.  These figures represent 9.6 to 10.6 times 2014 forecasted earnings and a pro forma dividend yield of between 6.1 and 6.8 per cent.  Smartgroup is owned by Usaha Tegas and the Malaysian investment holding company, which is led by billionaire Ananda Krishnan, intends to retain a stake of between 25.0 and 30.0 per cent following the listing, the Business Spectator reported.  It added CIMB and Macquarie are advising Smartgroup on the flotation, which is expected to leave management with a 3.2 per cent interest.  The Australian Financial Review reported in May that CIMB has pegged Smartgroup’s pro forma net profit for the current calendar year at AUD 16.20 million.  It added annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation amounted to AUD 23.00 million and revenue to AUD 69.20 million.  The business as it is today was created in 2001 when Macquarie Bank and other investors formed a vehicle to acquire the assets of Smartsalary.com, which had been previously established in 1999.   Following the purchase, this entity became a focused outsourced salary packaging services provider within the health, not-for-profit, State and Federal Government departments and corporate sectors countrywide.  In 2006, Smartsalary became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Paxys Australia, a company now known as Smart Salary and which was controlled by business process outsourcing holding group Paxys.  Over the next six years the group started building up its presence in the Australian salary packaging administration and novated leasing industry through strategic acquisitions, such as SeQoya in 2009 and PBI Benefit Solutions in 2011.  In 2012 Smartgroup Investments, being a wholly-owned subsidiary of Smart Packages which was in turn a unit of Usaha Tegas, acquired Paxys Australia for a reported AUD 85.00 million.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Sopra has unveiled plans to acquire rival Steria in an all-scrip deal that would create a French information technology (IT) group with combined revenue of more than EUR 3.10 billion.  According to terms being proposed, Steria stockholders will receive one share for each four held, which represents an offer price of EUR 21.54 based on the bidder’s weighted average price over a one-month period.  The offer is a 36.8 per cent premium to the target’s close yesterday and implies a deal value of around EUR 730.00 million.  Once 1, the enlarged group would have a workforce of some 35,000 spread across 24 countries, allowing it to take on larger players like International Business Machines and Accenture.  Local rivals Atos and Cap Gemini would also face stiffer competition from the strengthened company.  Pierre Pasquier, chairman and founder of Sopra, extolled the virtues of the merger, saying the idea of joining forces has “always looked like it made sense”.  He observed the deal would enable the two groups to pool their portfolios, which span everything from software to business process execution, and benefit both customers and employees.  Headquartered in Paris, and quoted on the city’s stock exchange, Sopra touts itself as a leader in consulting, IT services and software development in Europe, helping clients with complex projects.  The company can trace its roots back to 1968, and over the years has grown through a number of strategic acquisitions.  Sopra generated EUR 1.35 billion in turnover last year and employs 16,000 people.  Meanwhile Steria, which has a workforce of 20,000 across 16 countries, provides end-to-end IT-enabled business services to private and public organisations, and generated turnover of EUR 1.75 billion in 2013.  Interestingly, despite being a quoted company, over a fifth of its capital is in the hands of its employees, and according to the terms of the proposed merger with Sopra, they will own around 10.0 per cent of the enlarged business.  The transaction offers geographical benefits as well, as Sopra brings a strong presence in France while Steria offers a broad international reach, stretching across Europe and Asia.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The move comes as the Parisian lender tries to improve its presence in the non-life insurance segment, which it believes is set for growth.  Sogessur’s products – focused on the personal accident, legal protection, home insurance and auto segments – is already sold through SocGen’s retail network.   However, the transaction will give it full control over the unit, which was founded in 1996 and had 1.68 million contracts covering more than 711,000 customers at the end of 2009.   Client numbers grew 4.3 per cent compared to 2008 and have consistently increased year-on-year in records dating back to 1998.  News of the purchase comes as SocGen revealed net income of EUR 680.00 million for the full year 2009. It described the last 12 months as “transitional” since reducing risks has been a major objective.   This might go some way to explaining why the firm is so keen to consolidate in its developed domestic insurance market, rather than pushing for expansion in high-growth regions.  Since the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008, western lenders, many now controlled by their respective governments, have increasingly scaled back non-core activities and refocused on the home market.  Late last year SocGen reduced its share in Ukrainian lender Bank Professionalnoho Finansirovaniya and today it said it would restructure its Russian operations.  Last year the group also sold shares in the speciality chemicals group Rhodia, while its UK-based private equity business SG Capital Europe was taken over by management.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Insolvency practitioner Bridgestones has been appointed to the firm which produces leaflets, fliers, calendars and business cards.  According to Crain’s, Everydayoffice stopped trading last month and Bridgestones is set to hold a meeting with its creditors this Thursday and is hoping to put the group into voluntary liquidation.

Cope said: “It is the first step of growing P81 into other market places which is something that we have been looking at for a while.   “Considering the economy it is very exciting. We have built the business primarily in the fitness sector but we're looking to float in three to four years time and we need to create a total brand solution.”   According to the British Printing Industry Federation (BPIF), Eurofactor, one of the UK's largest invoice finance companies, has come up with a liquidity package of up to GBP 40.00 million for the troubled print industry sector.

Canterbury Building Society (CBS), Southern Cross Building Society (SCBS) and Pyne Gould Corporation (PGC) are hoping discussions will lead to forming a group which will become the country’s only listed bank, with 360 members of staff and around 70 branches – a significant platform for growth.  A memorandum of understanding has been signed but transaction details are yet to be finalised and are still subject to further agreement and a formal proposal being signed.  Under the terms of the deal, CBS and SCBS are expected to merge and then acquire the corresponding PGC businesses, mainly its wholly-owned subsidiary, the finance company Marac which provides consumer and commercial lending services.  The resulting entity is expected to be headquartered in South Island, have a national operational network which will significantly boost the size of its business, the ability to enhance shareholder value and the aim to more than double its NZD 2.20 billion asset base in five years.  It will focus on providing services to individual New Zealanders and their families as well as to small businesses and agriculture.  “We see a significant opportunity in entering the banking market as it is clear to us that New Zealanders and New Zealand businesses are seeking an alternative to the incumbent banks in the markets we intend targeting,” the three companies said in a joint statement today.  Christchurch-based PGC, which traces its roots back to the 1850s as a stock and station business in Canterbury, offers financial, trustee, funds management and rural services.

The Kotelniki-based group incurred a net loss of RUB 1.14 billion in 2008 as pre-tax profit slipped 64.4 per cent to RUB 417.44 million from RUB 1.17 billion. Sales were 6.7 per cent lower year-on-year after a 29.4 per cent annual increase in 2007.  Late last year Reuters said Lion was considering exiting the US-based luxury potato crisps maker Kettle Foods to bring in USD 700.00 million.   In 2009 it sold out of Russian alcohol producer Russkii Alkogol, as well as the Swiss specialty bakery Russkii ARYZTA and the drinks wholesaler Central European Distribution Corporation.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The companies involved confirmed negotiations are taking place but declined to comment on the proposed value, Reuters suggested.   A person familiar with the deal told the Financial Times, which was first to report on the news, the price represents a return of nearly 3.0x PAI’s initial investment of EUR 790.00 million in March 2016.   Goldman Sachs is said to be pursing the acquisition through its merchant banking division, one of the biggest in the world and had USD 20.00 billion in private equity investments at the end of 2018.   France-based B&B Hotels is billed as a leading budget and economy hotel chain across Europe with more than 479 hotels and over 42,000 rooms.   Reuters and Bloomberg reported, citing the statement form the companies, that the group, founded in 1990, generated revenue of EUR 580.00 million last year and has operations in countries including Brazil, Morocco, Portugal and Slovenia.   Since coming under PAI’s ownership, B&B Hotels is said to have almost doubled its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.

       " 'Californian drug developer Jazz Pharmaceuticals is to acquire Azur Pharma, an unlisted Irish company which focuses on central nervous system (CNS) and women’s health therapies, in a move aimed at creating value for shareholders and a more competitive business.  The enlarged enterprise will be incorporated in Ireland, but keep the Jazz name and specialise in treatments marketed in the US.  Bruce Cozadd, chief executive of the Palo Alto-based buyer, said: “Our combined organisations would have a diverse portfolio of products and an international platform, paving the way for long term growth that builds on our current strengths.”  The enlarged Jazz is expected to generate revenue of over USD 475.00 million from 12 products and bring in more than USD 200.00 in profits in the 12 months after the merger finalises.  Azur chief executive Seamus Mulligan said the combined enterprise “would have greater operational and financial resources to enable its strategy to acquire and develop important specialty pharmaceutical products”.  Upon completion, Jazz’s shareholders will own slightly less than 80.0 per cent of the joint business, while the target’s equity holders are to control just over 20.0 per cent.  The deal has been approved by both parties’ boards of directors, and must now receive a green light from antitrust authorities in the US to complete. It is scheduled to close in the first quarter of 2012.  JPMorgan Securities acted as financial advisor to Jazz, with Cooley, Baker & McKenzie and A&L Goodbody providing legal cousel. Azur Pharma was advised by Lazard, Mayer Brown, McCann FitzGerald and ByrneWallace.  Dublin-based Azur markets its products through two CNS speciality sales forces and one focusing on women’s health. Its therapies include medicines developed to treat severe chronic pain, anxiety and panic disorder, Parkinson’s disease and symptoms of the menopause, among other complaints.  It also makes pre-natal vitamins and antipsychotic drug FazaClo.

       " \"Spanish financial services behemoth Santander is understood to be moving quickly with the sale of Interbanca after it announced plans to divest the Milan-based corporate bank's parent Antonveneta earlier this week.  Italian daily newspaper MF said Santander would be looking for at least EUR 800 million for Interbanca, which will not be part of Banca Monte dei Paschi's purchase of Antonveneta.  A report from Reuters lent credibility to the valuation today when it suggested Interbanca is worth between EUR 800 million and EUR 1.1 billion.  Without citing sources, MF said Royal Bank of Scotland has offered EUR 650 million for Interbanca and that there is further interest from a consortium of Italian investors.  With EUR 8.533 billion in assets last year, Interbanca specialises merchant banking and focuses on clients in the medium-sized enterprise bracket.   The group operates with 11 branches throughout Italy offering financing and risk capital services, as well as performing company valuations, assisting with stock market listings and research.  An offer at EUR 800 million would value Interbanca at 8.6-times its 2006 net earnings of EUR 93.4 million.  Last year was a year of sound recovery for the Milan-based corporate lender after it posted a net loss of EUR 38.3 million in 2005. However, it has failed to return to the net profit levels it saw prior to being bought by Antonveneta in 2003 (FY 2002: EUR 133.2 million).  Operating in an increasingly competitive market, Interbanca has seen the value of its total assets decline in recent years, dropping 3.5 per cent to EUR 8.549 billion in 2004-05 and 0.2 per cent to EUR 8.533 billion in 2005-06.   Santander is currently embroiled in the EUR 71.1 billion three-way break-up of ABN Amro with Fortis and Royal Bank of Scotland.  Its has sold off a number of assets this year including a 2 per cent stake in Spanish telecoms giant Telefónica at the end of October believed to be worth EUR 2.128 billion.  The Antonveneta sale, agreed on Thursday, could be worth in the region of EUR 9 billion.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

In a report picked up by Reuters, the Russian daily said the Rotenberg brothers, childhood friends of prime minister Vladimir Putin, would buy 79.4 per cent of the Moscow-based chemicals business by acquiring a Cypriot holding company known as Lagus Management.  Ukrainian billionaire Dmytro Firtash, who controls much of his country’s titanium industry, is the selling shareholder, Vedomositi said.  The report suggested a USD 2.00 billion price tag for 79.4 per cent of Minudobreniya – or all of Lagus.  The fertiliser business is part-owned by Norwegian agricultural products behemoth Yara International, which specialises in nitrogen-derived products. It bought a 30.0 per cent stake in 2005 for USD 49.00 million.  Minudobreniya was worth USD 509.89 million in revenue in 2009 (FY 2008: USD 683.70 million; USD 2007: USD 479.30 million).   Pre-tax earnings plunged after the decline in revenue between 2008 and 2009, standing at USD 70.56 million from USD 326.41 million in 2008.  The firm claims to be the only manufacturer of mineral fertilisers in the Central Chernozemny Region and has several decades of experience.  The Rotenberg brothers made the final two on 2010’s Forbes list of the 100 richest people in Russia, with an estimated worth of USD 700.00 million each.

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including both shareholder and Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) approval.  Formerly a provider of services to the mining industry, SubZero filed for voluntary administration last year before selling off its business and assets as part of a recapitalisation of its balance sheet.  Earlier this year, it consolidated its shares in anticipation of carrying out an acquisition that would enable it to be reinstated to trading on the ASX.  Western Australia-incorporated holding company Timok represents an opportunity to transform into a new base and precious metal explorer called Raiden Resources, which will list on the ASX in early 2018.  The target has already entered into two option deeds to buy Skarnore Resources and Kingstown Resources; together, these businesses own licenses to five Siberian projects in the West Tethyan metallogenic belt.  According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, there have been 1,911 deals targeting metal miners announced so far this year.  The most valuable such transaction was Alamos Gold’s USD 683.00 million takeover of Canadian gold explorer Richmont Mines in September.

The buyer has over the years purchased companies across Europe within various sectors, including the tourism and information technology industries.   In June this year, Equistone acquired UK-based Chartco, a distributor of navigational data and nautical charts.

It is business as usual for the government contractor, which bills itself as Britain’s local builder, though its shares have been suspended from trading in London, having last closed at 18.50 pence on 5th November.  Mike Jervis, joint administrator and partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), said: “Our immediate priority is to urgently review the financial position of the company and seek a buyer of the businesses.”  Exeter-based Rok is a major schools and social housing contractor, and works with more than 250 housing associations and local authorities from 50 offices across the UK.   It provides repair and maintenance, including plumbing, heating and electrical works, as well as construction and insurance claims handling.

So far in 2010 the firm has won private sector contracts for the likes of Diageo, Ageas Insurance and Tesco Underwriting. However, it has also made 750 people redundant because of work lost.  Jervis told BBC News that no one factor has been responsible for Rok’s demise, but he noted accounting problems uncovered earlier in the year and reduced public sector spending have been aggravating factors.

Using a set-top box, viewers can watch a host of television channels spanning sports, music, films and entertainment, as well as accessing video on demand and interactive services.  In October last year, the Economic Times broke the news that Tata Sky was planning to raise INR 20.00 billion by floating a 25.0 per cent stake, giving it a company valuation of INR 80.00 billion at the time of listing.

       " 'AccorHotels is taking the next step in an ongoing transformation from a hotel manager to a step-by-step travel services provider by unveiling exclusive discussions to acquire French bespoke concierge company John Paul.  Founded in Paris in 2007, the targeted business merged with US group LesConcierges in 2015 to create a self-proclaimed leader in loyalty services with a combined workforce of 1,000 people across all five continents.   John Paul partners with leading brands to offer a bespoke concierge available around the clock, seven days a week, anywhere in the world, to meet customers’ requests ranging from the simplest to the most complex.   Staff use a customer relationship management and data platform based on a behavioural profiling, as well as a network of over 50,000 partners in more than 50 countries.  AccorHotels noted: “Through this partnership [ . . . ] AccorHotels positions itself as the best provider of multi-nature services to guests, supporting the whole customer journey, from non-hotel offers to 24/7 assistance through an integrated and innovative solution”.  It is hoping to buy an 80.0 per cent stake in John Paul, with founder and chief executive David Amsellem retaining the remaining 20.0 per cent, in a deal that gives the business an enterprise value (EV) of about USD 150.00 million.  The acquisition is expected to represent a multiple of over 11.0 times 2017 EV to estimated core earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).  Reuters noted that in a teleconference Amsellem said John Paul could generate revenue of USD 60.00 million and have an EBITDA margin of between 15.0 and 20.0 per cent in 2016.  This could potentially increase to USD 80.00 million in 2017 and may even double to USD 170.00 million in 2018.  AccorHotels is continuing to push further into new hospitality services in response to challenges from Airbnb: it has already snapped up Wipolo, Oasis Collections, SquareBreak and onefinestay in a bid to expand its footprint.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Brewing giant Scottish & Newcastle (S&N) and takeover talk are constant bedfellows but the speculation has taken a new twist with reports suggesting that Carlsberg will seek to gain complete control of their highly profitable Baltic Beverages Holding (BBH) joint venture.  Reports of a bid by Copenhagen-based Carlsberg for S&N have been around for a while. A number of analysts now believe the Danish brewer has fixed its attention on BBH, not S&N, but the move being a prelude to a full bid for the British group cannot be ruled out.  On Friday Carlsberg chairman Povl Krogsgaard-Larsen told the Danish press that the group was preparing to buy S&N out of their BBH joint venture for between DKK 30 and DKK 40 billion (GBP 3.65 billion). Larsen has claimed the group can \"definitely see the advantages to having 100 per cent ownership of BBH\" and stated that the brewer has \"built up the capital capacity\" to make its move whenever possible.  There are suggestions that S&N is becoming increasingly frustrated with suggestions that Carlsberg is preparing a bid and will initiate talks with the Danish firm during which it will make it clear that the group should act in a way more suited to their partnership. Such repeated public comments are seen as disruptive to shareholders and unwelcome. A S&N spokesperson also claimed: \"We are very happy to partner both with Carlsberg and our other smaller partners around the world . . . We are content with the status quo and our basis for growing the company is to concentrate on shareholder value.\"  BBH\\'s key asset is an 80 per cent-plus shareholding in Russia\\'s biggest brewer Baltika, which has a 10.5 per cent share of the beer market and around 30 per cent share of the country\\'s canned beer sector. Owning all of BBH would allow Carlsberg to market its Carlsberg and Tuborg brands more aggressively in the growing Russian beer market.   In the Baltic countries BBH is the market leader with a 42 per cent share. Other key brands include Arsenalnoye, Yarpivo, Nevskoye, Volga, Don, Medovoye, Kupecheskoye and Uralsky Master. The joint venture consists of 19 breweries, ten of which are in Russia, four in the Baltic countries, three in Ukraine, one in Kazakhstan and one in Uzbekistan.  BBH accounted for 29.54 per cent of S&N\\'s operating profit in 2006 and enjoyed healthy results last year. Revenue increased from GBP 604 million to GBP 724 million and operating profit before exceptional items grew to GBP 160 million from GBP 115 million.  Edinburgh-based S&N\\'s half stake in BBH is governed by a shoot-out clause, which dictates that should its partner attempt a bid for the remainder, then S&N would have six months to trump the bid. Should it do so, this offer then must then be accepted by Carlsberg. Carlsberg\\'s Larsen has described the clause as \"brutal\" and \"has no intention of activating a shoot-out\". From Larsen\\'s point of view he believes S&N should contact the Copenhagen firm and name its price, a scenario that is not publicly being envisaged by its joint venture partner. As autumn begins, relations between the two could become unseasonably frosty.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Walt Disney Co, which earlier this week reported its first quarter earnings for 2017, has increased its stake in Euro Disney and announced plans to launch a tender offer for the remaining shares.  The leading entertainment company is growing its interest in its Paris theme park owner from 76.7 per cent to 85.7 per cent by picking up 90.0 per cent of the equity owned by Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal’s Kingdom Holding Company.  Walt Disney is offering EUR 2.00 per share to be paid in common stock, representing a 67.0 per cent premium to the target’s close of EUR 1.20 yesterday.  In addition to increasing its stake and leaving Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal with just a 1.0 per cent holding in Euro Disney, the company has announced its intention to launch a cash tender bid for all remaining scrips as it looks to revive the resort’s popularity.  Euro Disney, which is celebrating the Paris theme park’s 25th anniversary this year and has a current market value of EUR 940.00 million, has been significantly and negatively impacted by the events that occurred in November 2015 when the capital came under a terrorist attack that resulted in the deaths of 130 civilians.  Walt Disney’s efforts to pick up the entire business is expected to provide maximum flexibility to shareholders, address the group’s financial needs and support the long-term success of Disneyland Paris.  Furthermore, the Snow White and Cinderella creator has also agreed to support a recapitalisation of up to EUR 1.50 billion at Euro Disney, which is expected to include an EUR 1.24 billion subscription rights offering.  Earlier this week Walt Disney announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2017 as well as announcing the dates of new attractions, including Pandora – the World of Avatar, to be launched on 27th May, and Star Wars Lands, opening in 2019.  In the three months to 31st December 2016, the company posted a 3.0 per cent decline in revenues to USD 14.78 billion, a 10.0 per cent decrease in diluted earnings per share to USD 1.55 from USD 1.73 and net profit of USD 2.48 billion, down 14 per cent from the same timeframe of the previous year.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Shares closed up 1.5 per cent to CNY 25.85 yesterday.  The deal is subject to approvals from shareholders, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and the China Securities Regulatory Commission.  Jushi, which claims to be the world’s largest fiberglass maker, has total assets of CNY 18.80 billion, according to its website.  Founded in 1969, the group employs about 8,000 people and has a production capacity of over one million tonnes from facilities in locations such as Tongxiang, Zhejiang Province, Jiujiang,  Jiangxi and the Sichuan province, as well as one overseas base in Egypt.  Jushi operates subsidiaries in South Africa, South Korea, Italy, Spain, the US and India, among other countries.

       " 'InterContinental Hotel Group (IHG) is inviting new offers for its prestigious New York Barclay hotel after exclusive negotiations with a previous buyer – thought to be Qatari investor Ghanim Bin Saad Al Saad – failed to result in a deal.  The listed UK group confirmed the news in its third quarter results statement yesterday, adding it expects strong interest from a wider pool of potential bidders.   It also revealed its property in London’s Park Lane will be the next major hotel to be targeted for a possible sale, coinciding with the opening of its InterContinental London Westminster later this month.   In February last year IHG stated it intended to put the New York Barclay, one of its flagship assets, on the market with an asking price of up to USD 350.00 million.   Earlier this year, media reports named Al Saad as the interested party involved in exclusive talks with the group having just bagged the Carlton in Cannes.  The New York Barclay is a 1920s hotel built in the neo-Federal style, and stands on the city’s East 48th Street, just off Park Avenue and close to Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue.  With an emphasis on luxury, the 685 guestrooms and suites offer a home-office feel with dual-line telephones, large screen televisions and iPod docks.  IGH is heavily reliant on the franchise model, and has been implementing a strategy of divestments in exchange for management contracts, returning some of the proceeds of these sales to its stockholders.  In its Q3 results, the group said USD 500.00 million was paid to shareholders in the form of a special dividend last month.  The reasons why talks with Al Saad ended were not revealed, but the Telegraph cited chief executive Richard Solomons as saying there was no particular sticking point.  He added that while the door to the Qatari investor will be kept open, several other offers have already been received for both the Barclay and the Park Lane hotels.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The transaction, which remains subject to regulatory approval, is expected to complete in the first half of 2019.  Upon closing, the target will become part of Zeiss’ industrial quality and research division.   Headquartered in Brunswick, GOM develops, produces and distributes software, machines and systems for industrial and automated 3D coordinated measuring technology and 3D testing.   It has over 60 sites and employs more than 1,000 metrology specialists.

GOM’s products include ATOS, a series of industrial optical 3D scanners which are used to inspect sheet metal parts, tools and ties and turbine blades, among others.   Jochen Peter, head of Zeiss’s industrial quality and research segment, said: “With this acquisition, we are pursuing our goal of achieving a leading position in the area of surface measurement and digitisation.”  Based in Oberkochen, the purchaser develops, produces and distributes technology for the optics and optoelectronics industry.  Zeiss’ products include camera lenses, ultraviolet glasses lenses, binoculars and riflescopes.   Michael Kaschke, chief executive of the buyer, said: “By acquiring GOM and thereby expanding our solutions portfolio, we are bolstering the leading position of our industrial quality and research segment and will be able to offer even better solutions for our customers.”  Zeiss has over 30,000 employees across 50 countries worldwide, and booked revenue of EUR 5.82 billion for the financial year ended 30th September 2018, up from EUR 5.35 billion in the preceding 12 months.

       " \"China Eastern Airlines is planning to put around 30.0 per cent of domestic carrier Joy Air on the block in order to alleviate financial pressure, according to media reports.  The nation’s third-largest airline operator is in talks with Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), the country’s biggest aircraft manufacturer, over a disposal of an equity interest in the Xi'an-based regional flyer.  “China Eastern is in talks with AVIC about the stake sale, and AVIC is highly supportive of the plan as it understands our situation,” said Li Jiang, a spokesman of the Shanghai-based carrier, cited by Shanghai Daily.  Joy Air was established at the beginning of 2008 with a registered capital of CNY 1.00 billion (GBP 99.89 million). State-owned AVIC holds a 60.0 per cent stake in the venture and China Eastern owns the remaining 40.0 per cent.  Over the weekend China Eastern warned of a CNY 6.20 billion loss on aviation fuel hedging as of 31st December 2008.  “The government is the only one that can save airlines from falling demand and huge losses,” Li Lei, an analyst at China Securities, told Bloomberg. “No doubt, the carrier will get support for the restructuring plans.”  Shanghai-based China Eastern may also dispose of a stake in its Yunnan province unit, which operates in south-western China, Bloomberg reported, citing two company officials.  Its sources, who declined to be identified, said the Yunnan government has already begun discussions over buying an equity interest in the group’s local unit.  Li told Bloomberg: “China Eastern has never gained effective control over its Yunnan unit. It’s better to end the painful relationship and to start looking for some more practical tie-ups elsewhere.”  A decrease in demand for air transportation, brought on by global economic recession, has left the civil aviation industry facing a crisis.   China Eastern recorded a loss of around CNY 2.29 billion and a gearing ratio of 98.5 per cent in the first three quarters of 2008.  Shares slid 2.9 per cent to HKD 1.01 (GBP 0.09) on the Hong Kong Securities Exchange on 13th January from HKD 1.04 on 12th January to value the group at HKD 1.58 billion.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Blue Label Telecoms is purchasing a 45.0 per cent interest in South African mobile group Cell C for about ZAR 5.50 billion (USD 402.10 million).   The news follows an earlier statement in December, which suggested the country’s largest prepaid airtime and data provider will invest ZAR 4.00 billion for about 35.0 per cent of the target.  Blue Label will gain a share of profits on products distributed by Cell C as it faces consumer backlash due to slow network speeds.  The debt-laden target will be able to use the proceeds from the investment to repay obligations, which forced it into a restructuring with bondholders last year, involving a three-year maturity extension ending in July 2018.     Cell C expects to reduce debt to ZAR 8.00 billion through the deal.  The company has struggled to keep up with established players in the South African mobile market including Vodacom and MTN, despite expanding its subscriber base from 9.00 million in 2012 to more than 20.00 million in July 2015.  Last year media reports suggested Cell C was considering an initial public offering on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and could list by 2020.   At the time it was suggested that if the company was to list, Public Investment Corporation, which picked up a further 6.8 per cent stake in Vodacom for ZAR 14.83 billion in December 2015, may be interested in buying a stake.  As part of the investment Blue Label will pay ZAR 3.50 billion from available cash and funding while the remaining ZAR 2.00 billion will come from an agreement with Net1 UEPS Technologies.  In a concurrent statement payments processing firm Net1 announced plans to acquire 117.90 million shares in the South African acquiror for ZAR 16.96 per share.  Following completion, the company will hold around a 15.0 per cent stake in Blue Label.

       " 'French fashion house Christian Lacroix – famous for its expensive haute couture – has filed for protection from creditors in a Paris court as the company buckles under the pressure of the recession.  The current owner of the 22-year-old fashion label, the US duty-free store operator the Falic Group, said in an emailed statement it will continue to finance the company until a suitable buyer is found.  Over the last year the parent has apparently been in negotiations with financial partners and investors interested in backing Christian Lacroix but talks fell through on the back of the crumbling financial and economic markets.  Chief executive officer Nicolas Topiol said in the statement the final-stage talks were “directly hit by the conditions of the financial markets and could not be finalised prior to the filing”.  If a buyer does not come forward for Christian Lacroix then the group will be at the mercy of a ruling by France’s commercial courts, which could consign it to either a restructuring, or, the worst possible scenario, liquidation.  Shareholders are keen to keep the company afloat and are on track to present a rescue plan which will undoubtedly mean some staff being made redundant, the Independent reported.  Christian Lacroix was set up in 1987 and was bought by Falic in early 2005 from the world’s biggest luxury goods company LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.  Under its new owner the loss-making Parisian fashion house sought to refocus its business on the high-end fashion scale, repressing the lower-priced clothing and jeans lines.  However, this long-term strategy was \"dramatically hindered by the current and ongoing world financial and economic crisis\", the company said in its statement.  According to Bloomberg, last year it booked a loss of EUR 10.00 million on revenue of EUR 30.00 million (FY 2007: loss of EUR 9.70 million on sales of EUR 41.65 million; FY 2006: EUR 5.06 million on turnover of EUR 50.75 million; FY 2005: EUR 6.01 million on revenue of EUR 40.79 million).  Christian Lacroix is not the only big name in the fashion industry suffering in this recession.

The listed Melbourne-based corporation said it is in talks to buy the business and assets of the group, which is based in Smithfield in the Australian state of New South Wales, from receivers and managers.  McGrathNicol was called in to act as administrator to Lanark and has been seeking expressions of interest from potential suitors.  Lanark is a long standing manufacturer, importer and exporter and retailer of bathroomware and spa pool products with annual sales in excess of AUD 20.00 million (GBP 10.41 million).  It operates two distinct businesses; it is a leading producer and wholesaler of acrylic bathroom suites and supplies many of the largest plumbing retailers in Australia.  The firm makes and exports branded spa pools, swim spas and gazebos and it also manages five stores across the country.  The acquisition is subject to execution of an asset sale agreement and the suitor obtaining suitable finance.  Marbletrend distributes products such as baths, showers, basins and shower bases across Australia.  The past 12 months have been tough for a company that operates in the building sector but the group noted in its preliminary final report for the financial year ended 30th June that the resilient do-it-yourself market continues to do well – bolstering the group’s core business activities.  In FY 2008-09 Marbletrend generated revenue of AUD 36.88 million, up 45.4 per cent from AUD 23.36 million a year earlier.  However, the company took a hit of AUD 3.84 million at its bottom line for the period – from a profit of AUD 965,938 in FY 2007-08.

       " 'H Lundbeck said it has signed on the dotted line to acquire US pharmaceutical group Chelsea Therapeutics in a deal worth USD 658.00 million all told.  The Danish drug maker is offering stockholders of the North Carolinian company up to USD 7.94 per share, a tempting 59.0 per cent premium to yesterday’s close of USD 5.00.  Chelsea Therapeutics makes Northera, a treatment for orthostatic dizziness, light-headedness or the feeling of being about to black out, in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH) caused by disorders like Parkinson’s disease.  Lundbeck’s offer comprises USD 6.44 per share in cash, or roughly USD 530.00 million, plus contingent value rights worth a further USD 1.50, payable upon achievement of certain net sales milestones relating to Northera.   The upfront per-stock price is still a respectable 29.0 per cent premium over Chelsea’s last close.  Shares in the Charlotte-headquartered group opened a third higher at USD 6.64 this morning.  Lundbeck said the deal will boost its offering in rare neurological disorders in the US through the forthcoming launch of Northera, which was approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) in February.  The product is expected to be commercially released sometime in the second half of this year.  Northera is the first and only FDA-approved therapy that has proven benefits in adult patients with NOH caused by primary autonomic failure, dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency and non-diabetic autonomic neuropathy.  Lundbeck’s existing US franchise in the US includes Onfi, Sabril and Xenazine, which will be further strengthened with the addition of Chelsea Therapeutic’s product.  Northera will also pave the way for the Danish group’s potential future therapies like desmoteplase and Lu AE58054 currently in clinical phase III.  In addition to neurological products, the Valby-based group develops the psychiatric products Abilify Maintena and Brintellix.  Lundbeck said while the deal is not expected to have any significant positive impact on revenue in 2014, it will likely be dilutive to both cash flow and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).  Core EBIT in 2013 amounted to DKK 2.30 billion (USD 428.76 million) and this is predicted to fall to between DKK 900.00 million and DKK 1.40 billion this year.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Reuters picked up on comments made by Olaf Koch when speaking to journalists, as he noted that a number of prospective suitors have already expressed an interest in the unit.  According to the chief executive, a non-binding offer is anticipated soon, with a binding approach expected to follow around six to eight weeks after that.  Koch added that the ultimate goal is to sell the Real business in its entirety, although he noted that competition regulations are likely to make this difficult.  In addition, the chief executive stated that a good price is expected due to the target’s portfolio of real estate, as well as its ecommerce operations.  According to Reuters, fellow German wholesalers could be among the interested parties, but private equity investors are more likely to throw their hats into the ring.  A sale of Real was first mooted back in September 2018, when the company said it would begin the process of offloading the business in order to concentrate on its wholesale operations.  Since then, a number of potential suitors have been named in connection with a possible bid for the unit, namely Amazon, Cerberus Capital Management, redos real estate and MARKANT Handels-und Industriewaren-Vermittlungs.

The company’s annual sales total EUR 7.08 billion.  2018 was a fairly big year in terms of the value of deals targeting grocery store operators; Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, shows that deals worth USD 38.21 billion were announced worldwide, compared to USD 27.77 billion-worth in 2017.  The increase in value came despite volume declining xxx per cent from 726 to 623 over the same timeframe; the figure was boosted by a USD 10.02 billion takeover of Asda by J Sainsbury, which was announced in April and remains subject to regulatory approval.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'IK Investment Partners is exploring the acquisition of Denmark-based food wholesaler Løgismose and restaurant operator Claus Meyer Holding for around DKK 800.00 million (EUR 107.48 million), TV2lorry reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  According to the broadcaster, the private equity firm is looking to merge the two business and they will operate as one entity.  Løgismose and Meyer chose not to comment when contacted by TV2lorry; however sources, who asked to remain anonymous, confirmed the transaction is heading towards completion.  One person added the deal was approved by investors last week.  Citing a draft for the acquisition, TV2lorry reported that television chef Claus Meyer will remain co-owner of the merged group.  Both companies are behind some of Denmark’s best known brands including Meyer’s Deli and Chocolate Company and Løgismose’s chicken and potatoes business.  In an interview with Politiken Economy Claus Meyer said he has known the food retailer’s owners James and Michael Grønlykke for over 20 years and has been in talks about doing business together.  He added should he sell to, or join with, another group his role in the company is not up for discussion.  Meyer and Løgismose have grown rapidly in the Danish gastronomy industry.  The former posted turnover of over DKK 500.00 million in fiscal 2013, while the latter generated revenues of almost DKK 100.00 million, according to Politiken.  Løgismose is billed as a small importer of French wines and food.  The company owns restaurants including Falsled Inn and King Hans Basement, which has held Denmark’s first Michelin star since 1983.  Claus Meyer began as a TV chef and now owns several businesses and employees over 400 staff.  The companies include various eateries such as being a co-owner in Nordic gourmet restaurant, which holds two Michelin stars and was awarded the world’s best restaurant in 2010.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

A person close to the situation told Bloomberg that Thermo Fisher Scientific, the leading manufacturer of laboratory instruments, has approached the Massachusetts-headquartered life science group with an unsolicited offer worth around USD 6.00 billion.  The source, who declined to be identified as discussions are not yet public, mentioned the target has hired Goldman Sachs as financial adviser after receiving a bid and a deal could be shaken on as early as next week.  Joel Levington, an analyst with Brookfield Investment Management, told Bloomberg: “Strategically, a combination would make sense between the peers, as it would enhance Thermo Fisher’s exposure to the faster-growing biotech sector.”  However, it remains to be seen whether anything more concrete emerges from the reported talks.  Ron O’Brien, a spokesman for Thermo Fisher, declined to comment on “0s” while Karen Hall, a Millipore representative, said in an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg: “It’s a 0 and we have no comment on the 0.”  Millipore’s Nasdaq-listed shares advanced by as much as 23.8 per cent yesterday following the report before paring gains to end the day USD 16.01 higher at USD 87.35 (19th February: close of USD 71.34), giving a market capitalisation of USD 4.86 billion.

       " 'Royal Dutch Shell is considering selling its operations in Sweden, the multinational petroleum corporation said today, confirming a report from the 13th December.  Spokeswoman Kirsten Smart told Dow Jones in an emailed statement: “Shell has started to gauge potential interest in the Gothenburg refinery and marketing businesses.   “It is very early days and we are at a very early stage of the process.”  The divestment is in line with the corporation’s shift in focus towards the east; it has been pulling back in Europe, putting three refineries in France on the block and entering into talks with Essar Oil of India to sell three more – two in Germany and one in the UK.   Cited by Dow Jones, Smart added: \"Shell\\'s global downstream strategy is driven by several factors, including the reduction in capital expenditure in some markets and a refocusing of the downstream footprint, including a shift in our refining portfolio toward larger-scale, complex, integrated assets.”  On the 13th December the Sunday Times, without citing sources, reported that the oil major has hired the investment bank Lazard to tout its Swedish arm, which includes the Gothenburg refinery, a marketing division, and a network of more than 400 petrol stations, to possible interested suitors.  The newspaper mooted the possibility the disposal could be worth up to GBP 750.00 million.  Shell is a global group of energy and petrochemicals companies with around 102,000 employees in more than 100 countries and territories.  The conglomerate’s Gothenburg refinery has around 200 members of staff and the whole of the Swedish unit employs around 500 people.

       " 'Bayer is continuing its efforts to sell its radiology supplies unit with two potential buyers said to be interested, Reuters reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.  According to the sources, Italian healthcare group Bracco and French rival Guerbet are working on potential offers for the assets, which have been on the block since June.  Bracco is said to be interested in finding a partner to make a joint offer for the operations and has even appointed an investment bank to help seek such a spouse.  Bayer’s assets are likely to be valued at over EUR 4.00 billion, sources told Reuters, adding the company is yet to make a final decision on whether or not to sell.  With Goldman Sachs in its corner, the group has sent out information to potential suitors and an auction is expected to take place at the start of next year, the people noted.  Reuters was also first to report on the potential sale of the radiology business in June, again citing unnamed sources as saying the unit could be worth USD 3.00 billion.  There has been speculation about Bayer exploring such disposals in a bid to finance its USD 66.00 billion agreement to purchase Monsanto, which the company has since denied.  This transaction was announced in September; however, the deal is not slated to close until the end of next year as it requires approval from shareholders and regulators.  In November it was announced that certain backers of Monsanto do not support the proposal and have filed a lawsuit against the company in protest.    Bayer’s radiology business generates more than EUR 1.50 billion in revenues; however, the firm is looking to refocus its efforts on healthcare to prescription pharmaceuticals and consumer care products.  Sources told Reuters that the assets are also being offered to private equity companies interested in the sector, with Advent, Carlyle and Cinven among those that might consider teaming up with a strategic player to make a bid.  In recent years Bayer has offloaded a number of businesses, including its vascular catheters unit for USD 415.00 million and its blood glucose meter operations for EUR 1.00 billion, as well as considering the sale of its dermatology division, which could reportedly fetch EUR 1.00 billion in a sale.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Indian airline SpiceJet revealed it is in advanced negotiations with an external investor for a possible cash injection just days after posting its biggest ever annual loss.  The news gave a much-needed boost to stock in the country’s fourth-largest carrier by market, hitting its highest in a month.  In an emailed statement today, SpiceJet confirmed it is seeking outside funding to help pay debt, but stopped short of identifying its potential rescuer.  Last week, the group reported a loss of INR 10.03 billion (USD 171.21 million) for the 12 months ended 31st March 2014.  SpiceJet, owned by billionaire Kalanithi Maran, is India’s number two budget airline but has been feeling the effects of rising fuel prices and intense competition.  In its weakened state, the carrier is in the crosshairs of a number of overseas carriers after the government relaxed rules in 2012 allowing foreign players to purchase up to 49.0 per cent of local firms.  Earlier this year, SpiceJet reported 10.0 per cent growth in passenger numbers and a 14.0 per cent increase in revenue during the quarter ended 31st December 2013, but these positive results were tempered by cost increases, driven by a weaker rupee.  This was magnified in the group’s full-year results, which showed that although revenue was up by 11.5 per cent, expenses jumped by almost a quarter from INR 58.93 billion in FY 2013 to INR 73.04 billion, of which fuel accounted for around 45.0 per cent.  SpiceJet has now been forced to consider tough measures to try to mitigate the effects of weak demand and spiralling costs.  According to a report by Mint earlier today, the airline is planning to cut as much as 30.0 per cent of its ground staff, although this was refuted by the company.  The emailed statement from SpiceJet contained stirring language, with talk of “going after cost optimisation on a war footing now”.   Investors welcomed the positive tone, bidding up shares in the Gurgaon group by 3.3 per cent to close at INR 17.10, the highest since mid-April.  SpiceJet is not alone in its struggles, as five of India’s top six carriers are losing money, with only number one player IndiaGo seemingly unaffected by the adverse trading climate.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The consideration will be funded from existing cash and debt facilities, giving the target an enterprise value of roughly AUD 700.00 million.   Mick McCormack, managing director of the buyer, noted: “The acquisition fits with APA’s growth strategy to build out our energy infrastructure business and to leverage our asset management, development and operational capabilities.”   Completion is expected on 31st March 2016 and the deal will enable the purchaser to further diversify its revenue base and deliver increased returns to its stockholders.  Founded in 2000, Sydney-based APA is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and is billed as the largest natural gas infrastructure business in the country.  The company generated revenue of AUD 1.55 billion in the financial year ended 30th June 2015, an 11.3 per cent rise on AUD 1.40 billion in the previous 12 months.   Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation totalled AUD 1.27 billion for the period (FY 2014: AUD 747.33 million).  DPS is a large scale gas power station that operates two separate facilities, the 242 megawatt (MW) combined cycle gas turbine Diamantina Power Station and the adjacent 60MW open cycle turbine Leichhardt Power Station.  According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, there have been 23 deals targeting Australian electric power generation, transmission and distribution firms announced over the last 12 months.

       " 'Austin Engineering, a Brisbane-based engineering business that services the metal fabrication and construction industry, is set to become a takeover target if reports by local media intelligence company Media Monitors are to be believed.  The publication claims that the recent volatility in its share price has led market speculators to suggest that contract mining, civil engineering and quarrying firm Macmahon Holdings is a \"potential predator\" of the company.  If Macmahon, which is backed by engineering and development giant Leighton Holdings, were to make a move it would be able to \"take advantage of the strong resource industry conditions and move into higher margins and value-adding businesses such as manufacture of specialist mining products\" according to the report.  Austin Engineering has manufacturing facilities in Perth, Brisbane and Mackay. Its Perth facility designs and manufactures products used in the resources industries (JEC products), including: dump truck bodies; excavator and loader buckets; materials handling equipment; large service vehicles; and tyre handlers.  Its Brisbane facility provides fabrication facilities servicing the mining, oil, gas and industrial sectors and its Mackay operations offer repair and maintenance services to the Bowen Basin and Indonesia resources sectors.  Austin saw a 13.4 per cent increase in its operating profit during fiscal 2007 to AUD 7.314 million, on top of a 174.5 per cent increase in fiscal 2006. Turnover climbed a further 8.8 per cent to AUD 57.31 million and was as little as AUD 1.615 million just five years ago.  At the end of the last financial year the company was carrying AUD 2.224 million of net debt after being in a net cash position the previous year (AUD 9.742 million).   Austin also has a manufacturing facility in Oman through a joint venture, which  manufactures busbars and other key assemblies for the Sohar Aluminium Smelter project in Sohar, Oman.  In early December Austin handed over AUD 19 million to the owners of US-based Western Technology Services International - equivalent to a multiple of 3.2 times forecast earnings before interest and tax for fiscal 2008.  This move will provide Austin with a platform to target the strong resources markets of North and South America and Canada and gave them the intellectual property for lightweight dump truck bodies.  With these plans for international expansion in place it seems likely that Austin has its own strategy and could prefer to remain autonomous, unless it gets a very tempting offer.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Italian Foster diabetes formulation manufacturer Chiesi Farmaceutici is hoping to curry favour with minority shareholders by tabling a bid representing a premium of between a fifth and a quarter to the close of USD 5.35 on 15th February.  The Parma-headquartered suitor sent a formal letter to Cornerstone’s board at the beginning of the week, indicating a desire to acquire the remaining 40.0 per cent stake at a range between USD 6.40 and USD 6.70 per share in cash.  Chiesi’s bid is also 24.0 per cent to 30.0 per cent higher than the North Carolina-based medicine developer’s 60 trading-day volume weighted average stock price of USD 5.15.  The manufacturer noted the acquisition would be in line with a strategy it has been following for the past several years to dedicate “significant resources towards the organisational goal of expanding” its global presence in the research and development of pharmaceutical products, focusing in particularly on respiratory diseases and neonatology.  In a statement released today before the stock markets opened, Cornerstone noted the approach, which has been filed with the US securities regulator, but warned shareholders it has not made a decision on way or another about the proposal.  The pharmaceutical company buys, develops and brings to the market products mainly focused on the respiratory and related markets.  It seeks out opportunities to acquire businesses or the rights to patent-protected, branded respiratory or similar pharmaceutical products, or late-stage candidates.  Cornerstone also implements life cycle management strategies to maximise the potential value and competitive position of its own currently marketed medicines, newly purchased treatments and candidates that are currently in development, according to its website.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The London-listed dairy foods maker said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange that the review would examine all options in order to ‘maximise shareholder value’.  Citing analysts, Reuters said the deal could fetch around GBP 300.00 million.  St Hubert spreads are produced in Ludres, north eastern France, for sale both domestically and in Italy.   According to the website, the Cholegram, Le Fleurier and Omega 3 brands are the top sellers in France, while Vallé is the most popular in Italy.    These products account for 36.0 per cent of spreads in France, and 60.0 per cent in Italy.   St Hubert was formed from the collaboration between six French dairy co-operatives to sell their products in Alsace.   Dairy Crest later bought the unit in 2007 for EUR 370.00 million.  In its statement, the Surrey based food maker pointed out that St Hubert has been a successful part of the group, and has consistently increased its market share and profitability.  However, it went on to say that it had not been able to make any further acquisitions in Europe to complement the French subsidiary, and therefore concluded that the best option for shareholders may be a sale.  Dairy Crest added it would continue to develop its UK operations, including its brand portfolio which comprises leading names such as Cathedral City, Country Life, Clover and Frijj.  Last June, the Financial Times reported that the listed group was considering acquiring a yogurt business to fill the gap left by the sale of its stake in a joint venture with Yoplait in 2009.  Shares in Dairy Crest have fallen steadily since a high of GBP 4.07 last May, hitting a low of GBP 3.11 at the end of January.

A total of seven companies are in the race to take a 5 per cent stake in DSE, with Financial Technologies India, Horizon Asset Management of the US and Kuwait-based Noor Financial Investments among the potential bidders.  DSE director Bharat Bhushan Sahny said stocks would be sold at INR 130-165 apiece, with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu handling the sale.  The group is hoping to raise cash by offering a 51 per cent stake, though Indian regulators will not allow foreign investors to hold more than 5 per cent each of DSE's shares.   A New Deli-based platform, DSE has not traded shares since 2004-05 and is keen to attract investment to allow for technology upgrades which will revive its operations, according to Reuters.  The sale is likely to attract interest from around the world, as demonstrated by the interest surrounding Mumbai's rival exchange - one of India's largest.   In February Deutsche Börse agreed to take a 5 per cent stake in the Bombay Stock Exchange, while the Singapore Stock Exchange awaits a similar deal. Both transactions are valued at INR 1.890 billion.  This year has also seen interest in the Mumbai bourse from India Times Media Group owner Bennett, Coleman & Co., and US asset management firm Atticus Capital, while NYSE Group and Goldman Sachs have deals with India's National Stock Exchange awaiting approval from regulators.   With the trading of stocks and shares reaching record highs recently, investors are undoubtedly looking to pick up bargain shares in the New Deli exchange and see it operational once more.   BSE's benchmark index Sensex reached an 11th record high in 14 sessions on Thursday, up 1.6 per cent, demonstrating the potential for success in New Deli. Sandeepa Vig Arora, vice-president at India Infoline, told Reuters that Sensex could extend its record due to the huge amount of money in the market.\",\n",

In a statement, the group said the process for divesting the remaining businesses is ongoing, adding that further announcements will be made as and when appropriate.  The joint venture partners make strange bedfellows; while ING is a major player in the insurance industry, Exide is India’s largest automotive and industrial batteries maker.  Headquartered in Bangalore, Vysya Life serves upwards of one million customers in over 200 cities throughout the country, distributing its products through more than 30,000 advisors, bancassurance partner ING Vysya Bank, referral partners, corporate agents and brokers.  Exide bought into the venture in July 2005, paying USD 47.00 million for the 50.0 per cent stake held by GMR Industries in a deal that valued Vysya Life at USD 94.00 million, according to VCCircle.   The website added that with this latest sale, the firm is now worth USD 205.00 million.  ING noted the transaction does not impact on ING Vysya Bank, a quoted company in which the Dutch group holds a 44.0 per cent interest, nor its Indian fund management business.  Once regulators have given the go-ahead, the deal is expected to close during the first half of this year.  ING has successfully jettisoned a number of its Asian activities in the last few months, which started back in October with the sale of its Malaysian insurance businesses to AIA for EUR 1.30 billion.

The Brazilian firm joins a raft of oil and gas majors which are selling off upstream assets to invest in exploration.  “We are considering to have [sic] some partners so that they could invest in Nansei Sekiyu,” Kawakami told Bloomberg. “We are concentrating more investments in pre-salt Brazil.”     Petrobras took full control of the company last year, buying out minority shareholder Sumitomo for an undisclosed sum. It acquired an 87.5 per cent stake from ExxonMobil’s TonenGeneral Sekiyu in 2007.  The target company operates the 100,000-barrel per day Nansei Sekiyu Kabushiki Kaisha refinery in Okinawa.   It forms part of a distribution network serving Asia, refining light oil and producing high-quality derivatives.  It is at the centre of Petrobras’s derivatives and biofuel strategy in the region, as it has close links to Singapore and South Korea, and is the Brazilian firm’s first Asian refining operation.    The site was not damaged by the earthquake and tsunami off the Pacific coast of Tohoku earlier this year, which devastated swathes of east Japan.  Petrobras has a major capital investment plan – reported by Bloomberg as the largest in the world at USD 224.70 billion though to 2015 – and is looking for USD 13.60 billion from asset sales to finance new projects.

Citing a source, the business gossip site said carrying out acquisitions could be one way of increasing sales, thereby addressing a decline in the prospective acquiror’s share price.  The person said that despite the fact that the two firms’ business models differ significantly from one another, a purchase could help to position the buyer effectively for what will be an uncertain future.  Despite this, as pointed out by Business Insider in its report on the situation, any deal would require Swedish investor Kinnevik’s sign off; the Stockholm-based firm holds a third of Zalando.  H&M’s value has steadily declined over the last few years; stock closed at SEK 160.80 on 10th January 2017, the last trading day prior to Börsgolvet’s article, compared to a close of SEK 253.60 on 2nd January 2017.   However, the firm’s value has been on the slide since 2015, according to the Financial Times (FT).  A particularly large drop occurred back in December; shares finished the day at SEK 200.30 on 14th December, before plummeting to close at SEK 174.30 on 15th.  This followed an announcement by H&M that its sales growth for the final quarter of last year had been significantly below expectations, noting that reduced footfall in its physical stores has impacted results.  The FT also cited the Internet as a large factor in the firm’s declining fortunes, noting that the group has yet to capitalise on the online sector effectively, despite having been an early adopter of online retailing.  Other issues have not helped; earlier this week H&M was forced to issue an apology over a “poorly-judged” product and image after an advertisement for a children’s sweater caused controversy and was judged as racist by many on social media.  This resulted in a number of celebrities, including the Weeknd and G-Eazy, ending their partnerships with H&M.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The acquisition represents an opportunity for offshore oilfield support company Swiber and minority shareholders to take money off the table for a premium of 39.6 per cent to the 12-month volume weighted average price.  At SGD 0.80 per share, the offer also reflects a multiple of 1.8 times price-to-net tangible assets and is a premium of around 78.4 per cent over the company’s net asset value as at 30th September 2013.  Swiber, which owns 57.5 per cent of Kreuz, will receive SGD 256.20 million for its entire stake and expects to record a net gain of about USD 90.60 million from the sale.  The construction and support services provider intends to plough proceeds into funding operations and undertaking business expansion, acquisitions and new investment opportunities.   Meanwhile Sea9 will be getting its hands on a focused group with a strong reputation and track record.  However, the would-be buyer is planning to put Kreuz under the spotlight by kicking off a strategic and operational review of the organisation, businesses and activities.  Sea9 did stress it has no intentions to introduce major changes, redeploy fixed assets or make redundancies.  Kreuz was established in July 2008 as the offshore services division of the Swiber before listing on the Catalist Board of the Singapore Exchange Securities just two years later and switching to the main board in October 2012.  Today the company is billed as one of the leading subsea providers for the oil and gas industry, offering construction and installation to support new offshore projects and inspection, repair and maintenance of existing production and pipeline facilities.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'AAC Capital UK is gauging buyer interest in its kettle safety firm Strix in a deal that could fetch USD 500.00 million, three sources privy to the matter told Reuters.  The former private equity arm of ABN Amro has tapped Lazard to sell holding company Strix Investments, which is headquartered in the Isle of Man but has offices throughout Europe and Asia.  An auction is expected to get underway at the end of the month and interest could come from other buyout firms and Chinese bidders, two of the sources said, asking not to be identified as they are not authorised to talk to the media.  None of the parties named in the report commented or were available to respond, Reuters noted.  Strix designs and manufactures a range of components to improve the performance and safety of kettles, immersed and concealed heaters, coffee machines and steam boilers.  Its products are used in appliances and systems made by world-famous consumer electronics brands such as Morphy Richards, Tefal and Breville, as well as major retailers like Tesco and Carrefour.  Strix was founded in 1951 in the Isle of Man as Castletown Thermostats, when it designed and manufactured thermostatic controls for small domestic appliances, and has since expanded to have offices in Belgium, Russia, China and Hong Kong.  Today, its components are used in a wide variety of electrical and electronic equipment, for example to protect against kettles boiling dry or being accidentally switched on when there is no water inside.  One in five people use Strix’s safety control devices more than 1.00 billion times every day, according to its website.  In 2005 AAC, or ABN Amro Capital as it was then known, acquired the business for GBP 300.00 million from Montagu Private Equity, previously HSBC’s investment arm.  Strix has core annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of around USD 60.00 million and could command roughly eight times that amount, according to two of the sources, who are hoping to back prospective bidders, Reuters said.  The news provider noted that there is high demand for European technology companies in China, although the UK firm is also likely to attract private equity buyers because of its potential for growth in the world’s second-biggest economy.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Ross Video plans to change the name of Codan Broadcast Products to Ross Video, but continue operating from the company’s current location in Melbourne.  Codan Broadcast, which was formed by Codan’s acquisition of Provideo Systems and Talia Sound and Vision, supplies a variety of communications products to Australian and international TV broadcast markets.  Mike Heard, chief executive of Codan, said the customers of Codan Broadcast will benefit from the experience and reputation of Ross Video.  Founded in 1959, Newton-based Codan claims to be an international leader in its market with around 500 employees and products sold in over 150 countries.  Canada-based Ross Video, which also manufactures communications equipment, acquired Netherlands-based audio visual software developer Media Refinery in 2009.

Codan also showed its interest in diversifying into different markets in 2009, when it acquired US-based Locus Microwave. Mike Heard, managing director of Codan, said the deal would capitalise on the government’s X-Band satellite communications market.

According to the Times, the Belgian brewer of Stella Artois and Beck’s could fetch between GBP 10.00 million and GBP 15.00 million.  The sale would exclude Bass’s red triangle trade mark, the Times said. It was the first British trade mark ever to be registered and is well known in lucrative niche markets in Asia and the US.  International rights to Bass beer, including exports to the US, would also remain under AB InBev’s control, the paper said.  The divestment will be a scaling back of the Belgian’s UK activities, and according to the Times, might also see Boddingtons and Flowers go on the block.  Bass is brewed under contract by rival Marston’s, which owns Pedigree ale.  Sales have been in decline for some time, having peaked in the 1980s. Between 2001 and 2008 Bass Beers Worldwide’s revenue plunged 77.0 per cent from GBP 72.81 million to GBP 16.72 million.  In 2008 the group incurred a pre-tax loss of GBP 0.56 million, down from GBP 4.00 million profit in 2007. It was the first loss in records dating back to 2000.

According to the sources, the suitor may take a share of the business so as to plough funds raised from divestments of its US assets back into its European activities.  However, a deal is not likely to take place until after BT’s GBP 12.50 billion acquisition of UK-based EE completes, which is expected to be sometime by March next year.  In addition, the Telegraph said if Deutsche Telekom is indeed interested in buying the business, the process would not be without sticking points.   Analysts said the German company’s planned exit of the US market could be delayed if Dish opts for a combination with Verizon rather than buying T-Mobile US.  On top of that, BT itself may be a less attractive proposition to European buyers if the UK opts to leave the European Union following its planned referendum, which is scheduled to be held before the end of 2017.  However, they did add that competition authorities are more likely to green light any such transaction between Deutsche Telekom and the UK business given the European Commission’s support of cross-border telecommunications mergers in the region.  BT has operations spanning 170 countries and claims to be one of the leading providers of communications services in the world.  Its primary activities include the supply of fixed-line services, broadband, mobile and television products and services, as well as networked information technology operations.

The geospatial unit’s devices enable subsurface investigation, detection of objects behind walls and the monitoring movements and vibrations of the earth for mine walls, landslides, and glaciers, as well as a wide variety of infrastructures like bridges, buildings, and dams.  Its structural and underground radar also delivers dimensional information such as size and location of buried pipes and/or the health condition of roads and rail tracks by finding cracks and cavities.  According to the website, IDS division provides equipment for geophysical, civil engineering and security applications and the addition will bolster Hexagon’s portfolio across segments ranging from surveying to construction and mining.

Jon Cox, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets, told Bloomberg: “Strategically, such a deal would make sense; Swatch wants to develop in jewellery and the Bulgari watch brand would fit well.”   “However, historically it has never done a big deal,” Cox added.

The Kuala Lumpur-headquartered public company noted in a filing with Bursa Malaysia that iCar Asia has been making loses due to expenses incurred in executing its growth plan in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.  It added that the Sydney-based advertising group has contributed a loss of MYR 6.48 million (USD 2.04 million) for Rev Asia in the financial year ended 31st December 2013, despite an overall revenue increase.  Following the disposal of 52.50 million shares, equating to a 27.2 per cent stake in iCar, the seller is expected to realise an estimated one-off gain of about MYR 210.23 million.   Most of the funds raised from the sale will be distributed to Rev Asia’s shareholders while the balance will be used for working capital requirements.  The iCar stake will be sold through on-or off-market transactions at a price to be determined later.  Either way, Rev Asia has to seek shareholder approval for the divestment, and is being advised on the matter by RHB Investment Bank.   iCar is an investment holding company, with subsidiaries mainly engaged in the business of operating car classifieds platforms like Carlist.my, LiveLifeDrive.com, Thaicar.com, Autospinn.com and Mobil123.com.   Its substantial shareholders include carsales.com in Australia and Catcha Group in Singapore.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Yanzhou Coal Mining is buying 25 per cent of Inner Mongolia Yitai Zhundong Railway from Inner Mongolia Yitai Coal in a deal which values the entire transportation subsidiary at CNY 7.77 billion (USD 1.18 billion).  The Hong Kong-listed resources developer and processor, through wholly-owned Ordos Neng Hua, is paying CNY 1.94 billion for the equity interest in the major network operator.  However, the main reasons and benefits behind the investment also include the fact it will achieve a level of cooperation with Yitai Coal, billed as the largest coal enterprise in Inner Mongolia and one of biggest on the mainland.   Along with becoming a partner of this major player, Yanzhou Coal will also be able to use the minority stake in Yitai Zhundong to expand production and sales at its Shaanxi-Mongolia base, where it has brought online newly-built mines.  The tie-up would not only solve the problem of outbound coal corridors, but should also improve local railway transportation capacity and scale up its assets in the region.  Yitai Zhundong was founded in 1998 as a Yitai Coal-controlled joint venture with China Railway Construction and Development Center and Inner Mongolia Venture.  The group’s main business comprises constructing, operating and managing the Zhundong railway, which links Yitai Coal’s mines in Inner Mongolia’s Dongsheng district of Ordos City with a coal transport network connecting western China to the east.  Its other activities include passenger and freight transportation, raw coal washing and sales, maintenance and repair of motor vehicles and lines, warehousing and equipment leasing, among other things.  As at 31st December 2016, Yitai Zhundong had an unaudited net asset value of CNY 4.48 billion and shareholders’ equity interest of CNY 8.08 billion.  Yanzhou Coal already has a railway transportation business; this division moved 9.97 million tonnes of coal during the first three quarters of the financial year ended 30th September and booked profit of CNY 208.10 million.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The firm revealed an early-stage expression of interest from a third party, which it did not identify.    “Discussions are at a very preliminary stage and shareholders should be aware that there is no certainty that an offer will be forthcoming,” Lok'n Store cautioned.   It urged investors to take no action and said a further announcement would come “in due course”.  It is unlikely that a deal would go through without the backing of founder, chief executive and 20.7 per cent shareholder Andrew Jacobs, who established Lok’n Store in 1995. Chairman Simon Thomas also holds 8.5 per cent of the company.  Shares in the London-based business, which has 22 centres across south-east England, have advanced 39.0 per cent since the start of the month even without taking today’s gains into account.  It closed yesterday at 53.50 pence with a market cap of GBP 14.29 million. At one point this morning the securities reached 70.00 pence, giving some much needed relief for a share price that has tumbled more than 70.0 per cent in 12 months.  In the year to 31st July 2008 Lok’n Store slipped back to a pre-tax loss (GBP 0.84 million) after recording profit in 2007 and 2005.   Sales were stagnant at GBP 10.83 million, increasing just 1.5 per cent from GBP 10.67 million in 2007, compared to year-on-year growth of 19.2 per cent in 2006-07.  On reporting the disappointing results, it said trading conditions would remain challenging.

       " 'Bankers are arranging leveraged debt financing of up to EUR 700.00 million for the planned disposal of a minority stake in French veterinary drug maker Ceva Santé Animale next year, sources told Reuters.  Les Echos said in October that Ceva’s chief executive Marc Prikazsky has mandated Lazard to find a buyer for the company in early 2014 which could be worth EUR 1.50 billion.  Sources told Reuters that several banks are vying to provide the debt package to the French firm’s management, a sign that confidence among lenders has returned.  Ceva is the ninth-largest animal health company in the world, and a source told the news provider financing of EUR 600.00 million to EUR 700.00 million could be for the taking.  This equates to roughly six to seven times the company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, which surpasses EUR 100.00 million, the person added.  Based in Libourne, Ceva was founded in 1999 and specialises in pharmacology and biology, producing treatments for infectious diseases capable of being transmitted from wild and domestic animals and birds to humans.  It focuses on researching, developing, making and marketing medication and vaccines for pets, poultry, ruminants and swine.  Among the company’ goodwill activities are providing health products for the world’s poorest livestock owners and supplying dog appeasing pheromone, or Adaptil, collars to the UK’s largest canine welfare charity to help give them a less stressful time in shelters.  Ceva’s global business operations are divided into six major zones: Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, including Turkey, North and Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, and Asia Pacific.  It has a direct presence in 42 countries, with 13 research and development centres and 21 production sites and a workforce number more than 3,000 worldwide.  The company was originally part of global drug giant Sanofi before it sold the business to PAI Partners in 1999, which in turn passed it on to Industri Kapital (now IK Investment Partners).  Ceva management and employees purchased a majority stake in the firm in 2007 with Euromezzanine and Natixis picking up minority interests, providing an exit for IK Investment Partners.  The Scandinavian investment outfit netted a tidy internal rate of return of more than 40.0 per cent on the sale.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

According to the paper’s Data Room column, the Melbourne-based business is first meeting with fund managers in its home city and will then go on to Sydney in the next day or so.  This follows a two-day non-deal roadshow in Hong Kong earlier in the week, a source close to the situation told the publication.  Aconex bills itself as the number one cloud solutions provider to major global construction and engineering projects worth a total USD 1,000 billion.  Its software is used in the infrastructure, energy and resources, residential and commercial and mining segments, to name but a few, handling tasks such as document management, bidding and tenders and field inspections.  Aconex was founded in 2000 by Leigh Jasper and Rob Phillpot, who serve as the company’s chief executive and senior vice president of products, respectively, and it employs a workforce of more than 400 people.  In 2008 the company received AUD 107.50 million (USD 101.51 million) in growth funding from Californian private equity firm Francisco Partners.  According to Aconex’s annual report, it generated global revenues of AUD 52.60 million in the 12 months to 30th June 2013, up from AUD 44.30 million in FY 2012.  However earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation showed a loss of AUD 8.89 million compared to a loss of AUD 3.27 million the previous year.

Money Today was first to report the transaction and said it could be worth KRW 1,000 billion (USD 918.70 million). The report cited an M&A source but gave no names.  Reuters picked up a statement from Samsung C&T which said: \"We are actively pursuing oil, natural gas and mineral resource business . . . and reviewing various resource deals across the globe but no final decision has been made on Parallel Petroleum.\"  The group is looking to take advantage of soaring commodity prices, and having control of upstream activities will benefit a major trading house such as Samsung Group.   Money Today said the would-be buyer has already appointed JPMorgan as an advisor.  Apollo bought Parallel for USD 483.00 million in September 2009 and delisted it from Nasdaq. If the US private equity group does get KRW 1,000 billion for the asset, it would be doubling its investment.   The Texan business buys and develops long-term oil and natural gas properties.   Its flagship assets – including a shale gas project near Fort Worth – are in West Texas and New Mexico in the Permian Basin, which is the US’s largest onshore oil and natural gas field.  Parallel typically spends between USD 5.00 million and USD 2.00 billion to acquire properties in the area, and looks for sites which can “significantly” boost its existing portfolio.  Its New York-based parent had USD 71.70 billion of assets under management at the end of June.  Parallel would be Apollo’s first exit so far this year, according to Zephyr.

Sources told Sky News that an exact timing is yet to be decided.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Numis Securities are overseeing the float.  People familiar with the matter told Reuters in March that Cinven had hired banks to sell the hospital operator, with speculation of the IPO coming to light in April when Express said the Spire could fetch around GBP 1.70 billion.

Spire was formed in 2007 from the sale of Bupa Hospitals to Cinven; the company owns 38 private healthcare clinics throughout the UK.  The group employs around 7,600 people countrywide and treats 930,000 patients each year.  According to Sky News, Damien Marmion, a senior executive at Bupa, said in a recent medical association conference hospitals are making a lot of profit at the expense of customers and the company’s priority is reducing medical fees.

HNA and Glencore have both agreed to an initial three year lock-up period in respect of their interests in HG Storage.   The Chinese group acquiror was incorporated in 1993 and operates in the aviation, hospitality, tourism, real estate, retail, finance, logistics, technology and shipbuilding sectors.   St Helier-based Glencore is billed as one of the world’s largest diversified natural resource companies and a major producer and marketer of more than 90 commodities.

Chile's largest water utility and primary water treatment firm, Aguas Andinas, is ultimately controlled by Spain's Aguas de Barcelona - through Inversiones Aguas Metropolitanas - so Essal will effectively remain Spanish-owned.  Iberdrola's exit forms part of its plan to divest EUR 3 billion worth of non-core assets to focus on a growth model based on renewable energy and the Essal sale was first hinted back in late March.  Aguas Andinas will acquire a firm that generated CLP 29.224 billion (EUR 40.18 million) in revenues during the financial year ended December 31st 2007. The 12.2 per cent improvement at its top-line filtered down to a 14 per cent advance at net profit level to CLP 7.875 billion.

Go-Jek started out in 2010 as an on-demand motorbike taxi hailing application, battling rivals Uber and Singapore’s Grab for the lead in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy.  Head of marketing, Piotr Jakubowski, told CNBC in May the company has been successful by thinking outside the box, by actually targeting issues of moving around cities like Jakarta without getting stuck in traffic.  Jakubowski noted: “The regional, or the global guys, took a business that worked in other places and just implemented it in Jakarta. Fact of the matter is, it doesn\\'t matter whose car you\\'re sitting in, you still can\\'t get anywhere.”  In fact, he credits Go-Jek’s rapid expansion from ride-sharing into areas such as logistics, food deliver and lifestyle by looking into this initial problem.  “That\\'s where a lot of the expansion has started, you know, you take a look at food delivery, you take a look at logistics and courier services, you take a look at very local things like massage and cleaning.   “Having people coming to your house and clean your house. This was stuff that had kind of naturally progressed and now we\\'ve just become a one-stop shop for everything you need to get done,\" Jakubowski told CNBC.  Go-Jek is now focused on Indonesia’s online payment segment to tap into a consumer finance market that is, according to president Andre Soelistyo, who told CNBC in an interview in September, ripe for the picking.

It subsequently postponed its final decision earlier this month.  However, it has now said both parties have made commitments which address its concerns.

Current shareholders in the Brussels-based group, which is one of Europe’s leading payment processors with more than 20,000 customers, include private investors Jean-Guillaume Zurstrassen and Grégoire de Streel.  Reports suggested Atos Worldonline, Global Payments, Total Systems Services and First Data as potential bidders, and said a number of buyout firms have also expressed an interest.  Back in 2007, when Ogone had just 7,000 clients, there was talk of it going public; presumably the financial crisis silenced this speculation.  The group is backed by Belgian venture capital house Compagnie Centrale after a transaction just over four years ago that provided a partial exit for the latter’s domestic rival e-merge.  Compagnie Centrale bought a 14.0 per cent interest, while Zuerstrassen and de Streel took on 16.0 per cent between them.   It is not clear which of the current investors is pushing for an exit.  Ogone operates in 35 countries with a presence in the e-commerce, ticketing, call centre, airline and travel segments.  It links to more than 100 different banks and acquirers to enable it to handle around 40 payment methods, including Visa and MasterCard, as well as Solo in the UK, ELV in Germany and iDEAL in the Netherlands.  The group generated EUR 14.70 million in 2008 revenue, having more than doubled the figure from EUR 3.50 million in 2004.   Sales growth was unbroken during the four-year period, pushing pre-tax earnings from EUR 0.80 million to EUR 4.00 million over the same timeframe.  Earlier this month there was talk of Romania’s longest established credit card processing company, RomCard, being up for sale.  Finance daily Ziarul Financiar said the four lenders that own the business – namely Romanian Commercial Bank (BCR), the Romanian Development Bank, Raiffeisen and UniCredit Tiriac – are looking to focus on their core activities.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The sole acquiror is Tan Jing Xin, who is also a major stockholder of the purchaser.   Subject to shareholders’ approval, the transaction is expected to complete within the first half of 2018.   WZ Satu is a diversified conglomerate listed on Bursa Malaysia under the ticker symbol “7245”.   Through its subsidiaries, the company operates a range of businesses, including steel and concrete manufacturing, civil engineering and construction, as well as oil and gas support services.   WZ Satu posted revenue of MYR 465.93 million in the 12 months ended 31st December 2016, up 32.6 per cent on the MYR 351.42 million recorded in the previous year.   Profit after tax for the period totalled MYR 23.02 million, compared to MYR 20.43 million in 2015.   The transaction comes as Weng Zheng’s business continues to be in decline and is faced with limited growth prospects, prompting the seller to cash out on the target to place more focus on its other activities.     Last year, WZ Satu also successfully disposed of WZ Steel, its loss-making steel manufacturing unit based in Indonesia.   This was followed by the public group’s decision last February to acquire Cekap Semenanjung, a Malaysian residential and retail units constructor, via an all-scrip deal worth MYR 30.00 million.

       " 'The Bahrain-based investor that took on Moneybookers two years ago is looking to sell the British online payment company, according to press speculation.    Citing a source familiar with the situation, Reuters said Investcorp wants EUR 400.00 million for the firm, which it bought for EUR 105.00 million in March 2007.  The Financial Times made similar claims in an unsourced report, and said JPMorgan has been hired to handle the exit.  The paper described Moneybookers, which enables instant digital payments and charity donations on a global scale, as having “shrugged off the recession”.  Last year it generated EUR 26.00 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. It experienced strong growth in ecommerce, with transaction volumes more than tripling to EUR 3.00 billion and group sales up 88.0 per cent at EUR 34.50 million.  The year brought sound gains in all areas of Moneybookers’ business, and over 9,000 customers per day signed up for one of its key services, the eWallet.  Clients include Unicef, Skype and AOL, and the firm has more than six million account holders, offering numerous different payment options in 200 countries.   Martin Ott, co-chief executive, spoke of “significant opportunities” in 2009.  “As the online retail market continues to mature, issues of security and fraud will mean that the benefits of the Moneybookers eWallet system become ever more prominent,” he added.  Along with Investcorp, London-based Gatcombe Park Ventures also has a stake in Moneybookers. It is not known whether the latter is also looking to sell out.  Investcorp made its first ever net loss in the six months to 31st December 2008, posting a USD 511.00 million hit for the period.  “As with all other financial institutions, Investcorp’s asset portfolio was also impacted by the exceptionally severe market conditions of the last six months,” it said in February on releasing first-half 2009 results.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Nasdaq, the second-largest exchange in the US, is currently evaluating the sale of its 31 per cent holding in the London Stock Exchange (LSE) following the failure of its takeover bid earlier in the year.  The current consolidation in the sector has seen both groups pursue separate acquisition strategies recently and Nasdaq believes that its current stock price does not adequately reflect the true value of its LSE stake. It is understood that both UBS and JPMorgan have been employed to assist Nasdaq in the sale of its 61.3 million LSE shares.  New York-based Nasdaq has estimated a sale of the holding would augment its stand-alone 2008 earnings per share by about 30 cents to 35 cents each. Nasdaq closed at USD 31.75 on Friday and the LSE closed at 1,270 pence and opened this morning at 1,289 pence, valuing the 61.3 million shares at GBP 797.513 million (approximately USD 1,580 million). In the last 52 weeks, LSE stock has been has high as 1,442 pence.  The LSE’s principal activities are the admission of securities to trading, the delivery of trading systems the organisation and regulation of markets in securities and the provision of associated information services. Last year it generated net profits of GBP 109.6 million (up from GBP 70.7 million in 2005) from revenues of GBP 349.6 million.   Over the same period, Nasdaq generated net income of USD 127.203 million (more than double the USD 55.09 million in 2005) from revenues of USD 1,657.776 million. At the end of the 2006 financial year the group’s total long-term debt stood at USD 1,492.947 million and its short-term debt was a comparatively insignificant USD 10.681 million. At the end of the last financial year, the exchange’s gearing levels stood at 124.15 per cent, down significantly from 583.36 per cent in fiscal 2005.  The US exchange has claimed that it would use around USD 1 billion of any proceeds from the exit to pay off senior-term debt with the remainder to be used to buy back some of its own shares.  Nasdaq is giving no assurances that a sale will take place. However, considering it believes the present stock price does not reflect its value and taking into account its holding is set to be diluted to 22 per cent once the LSE completes its EUR 1.634 billion acquisition of Borsa Italiana later in the year, Nasdaq will be desperate to sell.  Borse Dubai last week trumped Nasdaq’s bid for Scandinavian exchange OMX and the possibility is very real that Nasdaq’s second attempt to expand into Europe could fail unless it raises its existing bid. This is another bidding war it would loath to lose with it currently lagging behind the transatlantic NYSE Euronext following the NYSE’s EUR 10.59 billion purchase of European stock exchange Euronext NV earlier this year.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Both firms issued statements confirming the talks following an initial report by online financial news provider Inside Paradeplatz, which cited two sources with knowledge of proceedings as saying Valiant had offered to be a target for Swiss Exchange-quoted BeKB.  According to the article, a deal could see the target’s shareholders receive CHF 124.00 (USD 133.65) per item of stock, valuing the transaction at just under CHF 2.00 billion.  However, the parties did not comment on the specifics of any possible acquisition, saying only that the move is part of a review of strategic options by Valiant, which employs around 1,000 people and has a customer base numbering in excess of 400,000.  Founded in 1997, the company had total assets of CHF 25.21 billion in fiscal 2011, up 3.4 per cent on the CHF 24.39 billion recorded in FY 2010.  BeKB’s last acquisition was in December 2008 when it bought Swiss banking software developer Legando from Maerki Baumann Holding for an undisclosed consideration.  Commenting on the potential Valiant merger, Inside Paradeplatz said the Bern-headquartered group could alternatively pick up a strategic stake in Valiant as part of a deal.  No further details have been disclosed at this time.  BeKB employs 1,450 people and provides a range of services to its 500,000 customers from 79 branches.

Under the terms of the transaction, the California-based buyer will pay around USD 600.00 million in cash for the business.  Commenting on the reasons for the deal, Brad Rencher, general manager of Adobe’s digital marketing business, said: “The acquisition of Neolane brings critical cross-channel campaign management capabilities to the Adobe marketing cloud.”  He added that the group will extend its lead at the head of the digital marketing sector as a consequence of the purchase.  Adobe was founded in 1982 by Charles Geschke and John Warnock and claims to be the world leader in digital marketing and media software.  The acquisition will lead to the expansion of its current marketing cloud, with Neolane to be added as a sixth service alongside the existing analytics, target, social, experience manager and media optimiser offerings.  Neolane chief executive Stéphane Dehoche said his company’s existing customer base’s work will become easier and more effective following the deal, which will also provide an exit for the target’s existing investors, which include Auriga Partners, XAnge Capital and Battery Management.  Completion remains subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to occur during July.  Both firms will continue to operate independently until this time and Neolane will be led by Dehoche upon closing.  San Jose-based Adobe does not believe its forecast revenue and other financial results for fiscal 2013 will be affected by the transaction.

The Luxembourg-domiciled company in question was established in 2002 and is a managing general agent (MGA), writing specialist construction sector cover on behalf of insurers.  It has 37 wholly-owned branches across France, 360 employees and has a presence in 13 markets, including its home country, Belgium and French Overseas Departments and Territories, and has recently opened offices in Spain.   CBL began working with SFS in 2005 and the 11 year-relationship has resulted in the MGA becoming the largest building risk specialist in France.  Today it writes the largest proportion of Australasian group’s French construction-sector insurance products, mainly dommages ouvrage and decennial liability.   CBL noted the acquisition would include IMS Expert Europe, a business that manages the claims for SFS and other third party clients, and earns revenue from fees for these services.  The two European businesses together generated net revenue of EUR 41.00 million in 2015 and had operating earnings of EUR 8.20 million on a normalised basis.  CBL noted the acquisition is subject to usual regulatory processes and consents, including change in control from the Luxembourg Insurance Commission, and is expected to complete before the end of October 2016.  Managing director Peter Harris said the strategic purchase would help remove the distribution concentration risk that SFS represented in being such a large client, and would further vertically integrate and consolidate the group’s market position in Europe.  He added it complements an existing MGA in the UK, European Insurance Services, which also provides construction-sector insurance products in France.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Shanghai-headquartered Comtec, which manufactures solar ingots and wafers and which competes with Solargiga Energy, will submit an application later this month to hold a share sale on the Hong Kong bourse.  China is planning to seriously increase its use of wind and solar power in the next decade and will provide as much as 70.0 per cent subsidies for investments in solar power projects in an attempt to develop and install more than 500 megawatts of solar energy projects in the next two or three years.  According to media reports, the country could match Europe by 2020, producing a fifth of its energy needs from these renewable sources as it moves to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels – thereby loosing its reputation as one of the world’s top greenhouse gas polluters.   The People’s Republic’s unofficial goal is to have 10 gigawatts of solar power by 2020 compared with 100 gigawatts of wind power.  “With the government support for solar projects, the demand will be huge in the future,” Jean Wang, head of investor relations at Comtec, told Bloomberg in a telephone interview on 23rd July.

The group's stock price gained 8.6 per cent yesterday on news of the approach to close at 9.5 pence. Although the gains have been short-lived and Virotec was trading 5.26 per cent down at 2:09pm today, in the last month the company's shares have virtually doubled in value.  Discussions are understood to be at an early stage and there is no certainty that a concrete offer will transpire.  Virotec's range of services include: industrial waste treatment, municipal waste water, mine remediation, soil treatment and fertilisers, odour abatement, oil recycling and drinking water treatment.  The group operates in three main regions: Australia and Asia, Europe and the US.  The US currently remains its largest target market and it has identified three industries for near-term focus: drinking water from wells; phosphate removal from concentrated animal feeding operation lagoons; and wastewater treatment plants.  The identity of the suitor is being kept a secret and so far market speculators have not put forward any names as potential interested parties.  On January 18th it was reported that entities owned or managed by UK life insurer, Aviva, have increased their combined stake in the company from 14.76 per cent to 17.26 per cent.  This equity holding makes Aviva the stand-out largest shareholder in the group with the second-largest equity owner being JM Finn with a 5.78 per cent holding, followed by Fidelity International with 5.46 per cent.  Aviva has so far remained silent over whether it sees its holding as a long-term investment or whether it has been stake building as a prelude to a takeover bid.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

It is understood that Screen Service intends to acquire at least a controlling interest in loss-making in Teletext Italia but no financial details have been disclosed.  Based in Brescia in northern Italy, Screen Service manufactures a complete range of equipment for the transmission and the processing of analogue and digital television signals.  Teletext Italia improved revenues 141 per cent during the 2006 financial year to EUR 725,000 but net losses spiralled to EUR 1.098 million on top of a EUR 55,976 loss in 2005.  Teletext can be seen as an early version of the internet but unlike the web it is broadcast and the speed of its performance is not hindered by the amount of users viewing its content, which ranges from national and international news and sports to television schedules and interactive games.  Advertising revenue at such companies has been hit, like the printing press, by online migration. Furthermore as a number of countries switch over to digital television signals, Teletext has been pushed further and further into the background.  The information retrieval service was first developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s but its future health is encapsulated by reports last year that the BBC is to phase out its Ceefax service in the run-up to the digital switchover in 2012.

The publication states that global investment bank Lehman Brothers, which does not provide specialist services on the NYSE, is interested in the operation that Van der Moolen recently said it was terminating.  On October 18th Amsterdam-based Van der Moolen announced that it would make about 25 per cent of its US personnel redundant in order to further reduce costs. Less than a month later the group decided to terminate its US specialist activities, which match buyers with sellers on the trading floor.  In announcing the exit Richard den Drijver, CEO of Van der Moolen, said: \"VDM Specialists USA has not succeeded in bringing its operations back to profitability and will not be able to meet its second half-year US target. Therefore, we have decided to terminate the VDM US specialist activity as promptly.\"  The company will still operate in the US but from now on the focus will be on brokerage and CBSX activities. The group\\'s European activities have continued to be profitable and for the nine months ended September 30th 2007 the operating margin resulting from European activities amounted to EUR 17.6 million. Across the Atlantic in the US for the same period the operating margin from US activities amounted to a loss of EUR 11.3 million.  The exit is no real surprise as the role of specialists has been under mounting pressure in recent years as automated trading steamrollers the human element off the trading floor. What is a surprise for speculators is why Lehman Brothers would want to acquire the specialist business. It is now believed that around 85 per cent of daily trading takes place electronically.  SIG Specialists has also said it would stop providing specialist services this month. The two high-profile exits suggest a virtual exodus could be on the cards as the NYSE now has just five market makers, including units of Bank of America, Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs as well as veteran LaBranche and Kellogg Specialist Group. La Branche was tipped as considering a sale of the company back in July in an attempt to salvage its own floor-trading business.  Sources suggest that there could still be some value left in the unit, provided a bidder does not overpay, if rule changes on the NYSE trading floor are put into practice.

Lonsdale-headquartered Fibrelogic makes pipes from glass-reinforced plastic (GRP).  Its products are used in the infrastructure, mining and water supply industries.  It uses technology licensed from Norway-based Flowtite in its manufacturing process, including a continuous winding machine.

Nuplex has been looking for growth in its composites business.  Chief executive Emery Severin says Fibrelogic is an attractive proposition because its products, which he describes as “high quality” and “technologically advanced,” are sold to industries with “long term growth prospects in Australia”.  He adds: “The JV brings together RPC Technologies’ engineering and project management expertise and our own world class resin technologies and processes.  “With this combination Fibrelogic will continue to secure its position as Australia’s leading GRP pipe manufacturer.”  Auckland-based Nuplex has operations in 10 countries and its products are sold in over 80.  Established in 1952 as a flooring distributor, the company is listed on the New Zealand and Australian stock exchanges.

The would-be buyer made an indicative bid of 56.00 pence per scrip in cash, subject to due diligence and the board's recommendation.   This was a 51.4 per cent premium over the target’s 37.00 pence close on 21st May 2010 – but little over a fifth more than the close of 46.50 pence on 11th June before Cinven made its intention public.  An offer at 56.00 pence per share values Spice at GBP 195.47 million.  The group has recently been working to reduce debt and reorganise its operations in a bid to lower costs – an effort which recently brought the sale of its telecoms and gas activities.

Mojang is the brains behind the popular game Minecraft, which would give Microsoft a younger audience should a deal go through, the WSJ reported.  Minecraft is known for its Lego-like world which is filled with dangers and obstacles to overcome, including giant spiders and zombies.  Mojang has sold around 50.00 million copies of the game since it was released in 2009 and earned over USD 100.00 million from the title and related merchandise last year, according to the WSJ.  It is also available to console players on Xbox and Playstation, despite rather outdated-looking pixilated graphics compared to slicker products like Microsoft’s own Halo.  Mojang is also responsible for the game Scrolls and is currently working on a new project called 0x10c.  According to the WSJ, the Swedish firm has been approached for licencing deals including handbooks and Lego toys, as well as a Warner Brothers feature film.  The acquisition would be the largest transaction since Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella was appointed in February, and is all the more surprising given he has indicated that Xbox is not a core business.

As part of the transaction, Just-Eat will invest between USD 5.00 million and USD 10.00 million into the Indian website over the next three years.  “What we would like to do is to build a truly global success that is at the top of the food chain, not a company that is being gobbled up by a big American corporation,” he told the FT.

       " 'A company controlled by Groupe Banque Populaire has stepped forward indicating interest in taking over Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena’s French operations, Milano Finanza (MF) reported without saying where it got the information.  In an article published today, the Italian daily merely noted that Gallic lender Banque Palatine is the suitor which has approached the Italian financial organisation.  MF noted that Monte Paschi’s network in Belgium is also on the block but did not disclose how much the two operations may actually be sold for.  Founded in 1472 by the Magistrate of the city state of Siena, the group is one of the oldest surviving banks in the world, with over 33,000 employees working in 3,000 branches.  It is the flagship of the MPS Group, which is touted as a domestic leader in terms of market share, and offers traditional financial services, private banking, such as wealth management and life insurance, and corporate activities, including project finance and merchant banking, to more than 6.00 million customers, according to its website.  In March 2008 it decided to get its house in order, introducing a business strategy to rationalise its structure and enhance efficiency. As part of the streamlining process, which runs from 2008-11, it said it plans to divest a number of non-core assets.  Monte Paschi booked net operating profit of EUR 761.90 million in the first nine months of 2010 (2009: EUR 580.00 million) and posted net profit of EUR 356.90 million (2009: EUR 401.40 million).

Banca Monte Paschi Belgio is the only bank of Italian origin operating under Belgian law in Belgium.   The French division, Monte Paschi Banque, was formed in February 1990 when Monte Paschi bought Grindlays Bank. Some 20 years on and the Gallic unit has 370 employees working in 16 branches across the country offering private asset management, financing for large and medium-sized companies and a specialised service aimed at regulated professions.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Grupo Nutresa, a Colombian food manufacturer, is planning to issue new shares as early as the first half of this year in order to fund its acquisition strategy, according to a Bloomberg article that cited chairman Carlos Enrique Piedrahita.  In an interview with the news provider, Piedrahita said the company plans to sell up to 25.00 million securities in a transaction which will give the firm more liquidity.  Mauricio Restrepo del Toro, head of research at Bolsa y Renta, broker on the deal, told Bloomberg the issue is expected to raise up to USD 300.00 million.  The article cited chief Piedrahita as saying Nutresa will use the proceeds to finance acquisitions in the US, Caribbean, Central America or the Andean area. Potential targets would be drawn from the meat, ice cream, confectionery and biscuit sectors.  The Medellín-based business traces its history back to 1916 and the creation of the Fábrica Nacional de Galletas y Confites. After a number of mergers and acquisitions, the company emerged in its present form as Grupo Nacional de Chocolates. It changed its name again this year.  Its products include meat, cookies, chocolate, coffee, ice cream and pasta, and are made and sold both domestically and via foreign subsidiaries.  Nutresa has been involved in a number of deals in recent years, the latest of which was the USD 38.70 million purchase of a majority stake in Dominican frozen dessert manufacturer Helados Bon. Last year it agreed to buy Texan biscuit producer Fehr Holdings for USD 84.00 million.  In fiscal 2010 it recorded sales of COP 4,459 billion (USD 2.47 billion) compared to COP 4,588 billion in FY 2009 (FY 2008: COP 4,010 billion; FY 2007: COP 3,450 billion).

       " \"India’s National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) is rolling out plans to gain full control of the domestic settlement joint venture National Commodity Clearing (NCCL), according to the Forward Markets Commission (FMC).  In its latest fortnightly report the forwards and futures markets regulator said it has given the online bourse a green light to acquire the remaining 65.0 per cent stake it does not already hold from National Stock Exchange India (NSE).  The Business Standard, which picked up on the review, indicated the deal has an enterprise value of INR 50.00 million (USD 0.91 million) and could complete by the end of this month.  An analyst told the newspaper the acquisition, for which discussions are currently under way, would lead to smoother operations and should make the settlement of commodity trades logistically easier.  While this person added that NSE's decision to offload the clearing venture is indicative of waning interest in the commodity futures market, the exchange denied the statement.   NCCL was incorporated jointly between NSE and NCDEX and is currently the sole clearing and settlement company of derivatives traded on the latter.  The venture covers contracts in 44 products ranging from agricultural commodities and energy to base, ferrous and precious metals and polymers.  Meanwhile, NSE is attempting to ramp up its minority interest in NCDEX to 15.0 per cent, claiming that as a founding member it should be allowed to take a further 5.0 per cent after supporting the commodity exchange’s growth, according to the Business Standard.  The newspaper reported the FMC has rebuffed the proposal, citing recently revised shareholding guidelines which bar any equity bourse from owning more than 5.0 per cent of a commodity house.  Mumbai-headquartered NCDEX’s promoters include Life Insurance Corporation of India, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development and NSE, though shareholders range from Canara Bank and Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative to Goldman Sachs and Jaypee Capital.  The firm offered contracts in 34 commodities, comprising 23 agricultural commodities, six precious metals, two energy, one polymer and two other metals, as of 9th February 2012.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Austrian lender Erste Group Bank is considering a capital increase to raise more than EUR 1.00 billion in order to strengthen its capital base, it has emerged.  People with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg that Erste is in talks with four investment banks – including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase – regarding a possible offering.  “Erste’s main challenge remains capital,” said a note last week from a Bank of America analyst, cited by Bloomberg.  The Vienna-based business, Austria’s largest publicly-traded lender, would not comment on the speculation.  It had Tier 1 capital of EUR 7.64 billion as at 31st December 2008 and a Tier 1 ratio of 7.2 per cent.  Net earnings slumped 73.8 per cent to EUR 398.90 million last year (FY 2007: EUR 1.52 billion; FY 2006: EUR 1.18 billion; FY 2005: EUR 920.00 million). It was the first time since 1997 that Erste had not recorded growth at its bottom line.  Shares in the group closed at an intra-day low of EUR 30.54 on the Bloomberg speculation yesterday after falling 6.4 per cent.   It has a market value of around EUR 9.13 billion, meaning a potential EUR 1.00 billion issue accounts for just short of 10.0 per cent of its enlarged capital.  Erste’s stock price has climbed 51.8 per cent since the start of July, buoyed by improved confidence in global financial markets.   “Every bank that has taken up state capital will be rumored sooner or later to be raising capital,” an Erste spokesman told Bloomberg.  The business received EUR 1.20 billion from state coffers during the financial crisis, Bloomberg noted.  On 21st September, Unicredito Capitalia, the largest bank in neighbouring Italy, said it would tap shareholders for EUR 4.00 billion.

       " 'Ratos is preparing to float Arcus on Oslo Børs more than a decade after teaming up with management and Hoff Norske Potetindustrier on a deal which Zephyr shows was the fifth-largest Norwegian institutional buyout of 2005.  While details of the initial public offering (IPO), such as the size and price, are not yet known, the Söderberg family-controlled Swedish private equity house said all three shareholders intend to trim their respective stakes.  However, despite the listing, Ratos is planning to remain as a significant backer of one of the leading Nordic branded consumer goods companies within the production, import, sale and distribution of wine and spirits.    On one hand the IPO should support Arcus’ strategy and growth plans while diversifying and introducing long-term investors to its shareholders, and on the other it is expected to bolster the group’s profile in its home markets.  The company is the world’s largest producer of aquavit and has a solid position in the Nordic area, being number one within both spirits and wine in Norway and second within wine in Sweden and within spirits in Denmark.  It has a liquor portfolio comprising 70 Arcus-owned, as well as agency, brands ranging from Lysholm Linie and Løiten to Aalborg Akvavit and Gammel Dansk.  The group owns wine importing subsidiaries in Norway, Sweden and Finland which together manage about 450 agencies from producers all over the world.  Arcus has reported top line growth for 17 consecutive years, with an average revenue advancing by some 11.0 per cent annually since 2005 - achieved organically and through acquisitions.  Operating turnover has increased from NOK 863.00 million (EUR 95.01 million at current exchange rates) in 2005 to NOK 2.47 billion in 2015.  Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation has risen from NOK 31.00 million to NOK 274.00 million over the same 10-year timeframe.

Chr Hansen, which supplies the food and drug industries, might divest stock in an initial public offering (IPO) next year, the paper said.  Another option could be a full exit of PAI Partners – the French fund which led the DKK 8.20 billion (EUR 1.01 billion) acquisition of Hørsholm-based Chr Hansen in 2005.  The business operates in over 30 countries and is the world’s number one supplier of natural ingredients to the food industry.  It has market leading positions in cultures, enzymes and natural colours, serving companies producing nutritional and agricultural products, as well as pharmaceuticals.  Group revenue has grown consistently since PAI took over, increasing 46.7 per cent from DKK 1.40 billion to DKK 2.05 billion over the three years from 2005 to 2008.  Sales for the fiscal 2009, ended as at 31st August, were 10.0 per cent higher at EUR 511.00 million driven by strong gains in the probiotics segment.  Børsen did not speculate how much PAI might seek from an IPO of Chr Hansen, or how much the firm might fetch in a sale.  On releasing full-year results chief executive Lars Frederiksen said: “During challenging times we are able to not only grow our revenue and gain market shares but also to increase our earnings.”   The firm is “extremely satisfied” with its ability to generate liquidity, he added.  Chr Hansen can trace its origins back to 1874 when it was founded in Copenhagen by the Danish pharmacist Christian Hansen.  So far this year PAI has exited the Italian coffee machine manufacturer Saeco International Group, which was acquired by DeLonghi for EUR 200.00 million in July.

As a result of the sale, OMV’s refining and marketing business is expected to be more comparable with that of its competitors as they do not generally have similar stockholding obligations, having outsourced the activities in many cases.  In addition, the deal is in line with the company’s plans to restructure its refining and marketing portfolio in order to improve the efficiency of its balance sheet.  OMV has been linked to various sales in recent times, with a number of sources saying it could offload stakes in gas distributor Central European Gas Hub, Romanian oil and gas extraction services provider OMV Petrom and German oil refiner Bayernoil Raffineriegesellschaft.  The company has been less active as an acquiror, with its last purchase coming in July 2011, when it bought Petronas Carigali (Pakistan) for an undisclosed consideration.  In mid 2009 it divested a number of Austrian filling stations to a range of buyers, including Austrian petroleum wholesalers Leikermoser Mineralölhandels and AWI Mineralölgroßhandel.

The diagnostic imaging business is currently owned by CVC Asia Pacific and CVC Capital after they took it private five years ago in a AUD 2.70 billion in a transaction backed by debt from HBOS and Goldman Sachs. At the time I-Med was known as DCA Group.   Under the 2006 deal CVC also got the Lodestone network in the UK and Australia, plus New Zealand’s leading aged care facility operator.   The medical group has since sold the elderly care business to Bupa and now trades as I-Med Network.  According to the AFR, radiologists are likely to prefer the current owners to restructure rather than sell. The firm is heavily loaded with debt from its leveraged buyout.  Meanwhile, the senior debt holders are considering a proposal from McGrathNicol which includes a provision on loan restructuring, the finance paper added.  I-Med generated revenue of AUD 665.55 million in financial 2009, down 0.9 per cent from AUD 671.64 million in 2008. It incurred a pre-tax loss of AUD 664.14 million in 2008, which narrowed to AUD 190.08 million in 2009.

Reuters said USJ is worth between JPY 600.00 billion and JPY 700.00 billion (USD 4.85 billion to USD 5.66 billion), while several sources told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) the listing could value the operator at up to USD 6.00 billion.  These people added that Nomura, Goldman Sachs, SMBC Nikko and UBS will be underwriters to the offering.  It is not yet clear how much the company intends to raise in the IPO and the timing will depend on prevailing market conditions, one source told the WSJ.  Universal Studios Japan, which opened in Osaka in 2001, is one of four theme parks operated by USJ under licence from NBC Universal.  Among attractions are Universal Wonderland, which comprises Snoopy Studios, Hello Kitty Fashion Avenue and Sesame Street Fun World.  However, the jewel in its crown is undoubtedly the award-winning Wizarding World of Harry Potter, where visitors can see Hogwarts castle, built on a huge scale, and experience Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, which uses the latest 4K3D technology for added realism.

       " \"London-based digital media company i-level is in talks with several investment banks over a strategic review after receiving a number of unsolicited bids for its operations.  Citing people familiar with the matter, the Telegraph put a value of over GBP 45 million on the advertising company, which was worth GBP 54.104 million in 2006 sales.  Founded in 1999, i-level now offers a full range of digital communications services, specialising in digital media planning and buying. It counts William Hill and BSkyB among its clients.  According to the Telegraph, some of the approaches came from global marketing services firms, such as Aegis, while private equity firms and specialist digital marketing groups could also be interested.  The group has sound fundamentals and has increased sales consistently since it was established eight years ago. Last year revenue growth was 75.7 per cent, topping an average of 62.05 per cent over the last four years.  Net earnings, which stood at GBP 2.306 million in 2006, have responded well to i-level's growing sales and almost quadrupled last year from GBP 0.583 million in 2005.  The potential for investors to make impressive gains is also illustrated by a 38.3 point increase in return on shareholders' funds last year, which grew to 82.7 per cent from 44.4 per cent in the previous period. The implication is that i-level could command a high premium on its book value.  Should a bid of GBP 45 million be forthcoming, it would value the firm at 19.5 times its 2006 net earnings and may prove difficult to resist, though analysts have also speculated that i-level may be pursuing alliances rather than a sale.

       " \"French luxury goods company LVMH is hoping to secure the purchase of French business and finance daily Les Echos by mid-September, according to a local media report.  The La Tribune newspaper, Les Echos' main competitor and an LVMH-owned newspaper, said LVMH would proceed with the EUR 240 million purchase, as Les Echos' present owner Pearson looks to speed up the sale.  Britain's Pearson is believed to have backed LVMH against a EUR 246 million bid from French financial services provider Fimalac, despite the fact that Les Echos journalists have opposed the move.  If the deal is to proceed, regulators are likely to force LVMH to sell loss-making business daily La Tribune, its report claimed.   A statement from the Paris-based conglomerate, which owns Moet Hennessy and Louis Vuitton, said it planned to maintain editorial independence at the two titles, though this did little to dampen the fears of Les Echos writers, who have given Fimalac's bid their backing.  If the deal goes ahead, it will represent a significant media sector move for LVMH, which currently counts La Tribune, owned through its publishing arm DI Group, as its only business in the sector.  The two papers go head-to-head in providing news, analysis and background on economic trends, companies and markets, with Les Echos worth EUR 102.04 million in 2006 sales.  Les Echos has managed to maintain its revenues against a background of concern among print titles regarding the rise of online readership. LVMH has the potential to make gains by introducing subscription charges - currently a feature on La Tribune's website.  However 2006 gains over 2005 were negligible and the newspaper's sales have been stagnant since the start of the decade (FY 2005: EUR 97.933 million; FY 2004: EUR 98.843 million; FY 2003 EUR 96.039 million), after taking a small drop in 2000 and again in 2001.  Net incomes have been erratic over recent times, reaching a high of EUR 23.819 million in 2001 to fall back to EUR 3.735 million two years later. Les Echos realised a net profit of EUR 9.968 million last year, down from EUR 11.165 million in 2005.  Brussels-based Rossel, which publishes Soir in Belgium and La Voix du Nord in northern France, is interested in La Tribune if LVMH is forced to sell. So far, all signs point to the luxury products conglomerate swapping one title for a more prestigious alternative.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Dong Energy is selling Dong Gas Distribution for DKK 2.30 billion (USD 309.14 million) to state-owned Energinet.dk as part of a divestment programme that would pave the way for what could be the largest ever flotation in Denmark.  The utility is handing over the grid subsidiary and related operation activities, serving 122,000 customers in Southern Jutland as well as Western and Southern Zealand, by 30th September 2016 following various regulatory approvals.  It expects to make a gain from the sale of the enterprise – not part of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) – of DKK 1.50 billion.   Dong’s sale should not come as a surprise to investors; an announcement in September 2015 indicated the divestment would be part of a roadmap leading to an IPO at some point this calendar year.  The Fredericia-headquartered integrated energy provider said that in a joint understanding with the state, it would hand over the gas distribution and oil and gas pipelines to Energinet.dk “at an appropriate point in time”.   It also noted it would carry out a review of its exploration and production business, which operates in a structurally different market environment.   By January 2016 Dong said it would keep hold of the oil and gas arm in order to use cash flows from the operations to fund ongoing investments in renewable energy as part of its strategy of building a clean energy portfolio.  Just a day after Dong revealed its sale of Dong Gas Distribution, which had EBITDA of DKK 360.00 million in 2015, Reuters reported the energy provider could announce its IPO plans as early as tomorrow.  Two sources with knowledge of the matter told the news provider the company could follow up its statement with a prospectus within weeks.  Analysts have reportedly said the anticipated upcoming listing could value Dong at between DKK 70.00 billion and DKK 80.00 billion (EUR 9.41 billion and EUR 10.75 billion).  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Icelandic bank Kaupthing and Germany’s Commerzbank are the lenders increasing their share of Bay, which used to be part of the leisure empire belonging to property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz.

Iranian-born Tchenguiz no longer has any participation in the firm. He put Laurel Pub Company through pre-pack administration in 2008, making this the second reorganisation in less than two years.  Bay – and Town & City Pub Company – were the two businesses to emerge from the transaction in March 2008, acquiring hundreds of Laurel outlets.  Kaupthing will become Bay’s majority shareholder after the transaction, the Times observed, noting that management will get a “significant minority stake”.

The UK-based private equity firm reported GSPP’s 2009 revenue at USD 171.00 million and says it employs 1,350 people.  GSPP is the largest of three paper box producers in its domestic market, and is number one by customer base, scale and technology of production facilities, CVC says.  The ET did not name any of the interested parties aside from Ballarpur, which has the firepower of the USD 3.00 billion Avantha group behind it.  The Indian firm is the leading producer and exporter of paper in its domestic market and has a strong presence in all segments, including writing and printing, industrial and speciality.

The firm is being taken over by private equity firms EQT Partners and Santo Holding, with the pair paying EUR 21.50 billion, as well as a debt warrant, for the unit.  An agreement has been reached and completion is expected to follow during the first quarter of 2015.  Upon closing EQT will hold a majority share of the business, with the balance to be owned by Santo Holding.  A sale of Siemens Audiology Solutions has been on the cards for some time; reports emerged in late 2009 when the Financial Times Deutschland said a spin-off on a stock exchange or a sale to a financial investor were the options being considered.  By early 2010 separate stories had named Permira, Bain Capital, Cinven, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and a consortium comprising Australian implant maker Cochlear and Hellman & Friedman among prospective suitors.  In spite of the interest, the sale fell through as the target’s poor operating performance resulted in low bids.  However, the process was revived in October prior to the agreement being reached.  No details of which stock exchange Siemens Audiology Solutions will be listed on or a possible quotation date have been disclosed at this time.

Overcapacity, low oil prices, sluggish cargo requirements and weak economic growth have all contributed to freight rates falling to new lows amid a stagnant global market.  The imbalance in supply and demand, as well as a shipbuilding spree before the 2008 financial crisis, has not only destabilised the industry but has also meant most companies are making a loss.  Plans to restructure in order to cut costs come two months after the collapse of one of the world’s largest shipping lines, Hanjin Shipping, reverberated through the supply chain.  While the South Korean giant filed for bankruptcy in August, the 112-year old Danish shipping and oil conglomerate AP Moller-Maersk decided to break up into two independent divisions focused on transport and energy.  In a bid to keep afloat they are consolidating their container shipping businesses, including worldwide terminal operations outside Japan, into a new company under a joint venture scheme.

At CNY 8.10 apiece, the proposal for at least 69.06 million stocks is a premium of 26.6 per cent to the 30-day weighted average of CNY 6.40 and of 11.7 per cent to the affected closing price of CNY 7.25 today.  China’s retail industry changed dramatically in 2018 as on- and offline integration acceleration and e-commerce giant ramped up expansion of their business models.  The convergence of cross-border and retail formats has blurred the boundaries of the so-called new retail strategy, which is supported by big data and artificial intelligence technology, among other things.  Zhongbai is a large-scale supermarket and department store chain in Wuhan, Hubei province and had 1,255 outlets across the region as of 31st December 2018.  In order to keep abreast of the changes, the company actively explores new retail formats to attract a range of customers, have more coverage in the regional market and to offer flexible arrangements.  Zhongbai generated revenue of CNY 15.21 billion (FY 2017: CNY 15.21 billion) and net profit attributable to shareholders of CNY 430.95 million (FY 2017: CNY 67.65 million).  The supermarket division accounted for CNY 14.06 billion, or 92.5 per cent of, total operating profit, compared to 6.7 per cent for the department store arm (CNY 1.02 billion).  Zhongbai also has subsidiaries operating across logistics and distribution, packaging, electrical appliance retail and food processing.  Shen Jen, a senior analyst in the retail sector, told Yicai Global Yonghui is attracted to the company as it has clearly cornered the attractive Hubei provincial market.

       " 'Israeli conglomerate IDB Holdings is nearing a deal to sell a significant stake in Makhteshim Agan Industries (MA Industries) to China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina), according to Calcalist.  The unsourced report from the Hebrew financial news website was picked up by Reuters.  MA is the world’s largest producer of generic agrochemicals. Koor Industries, one of IDB’s main investment holding companies, holds 47.0 per cent of its voting rights.  The group makes products for crop protection – including insecticides, fungicides, acaricides, herbicides and plant growth regulators – which it sells in more than 100 countries.  It also develops, produces and sells fine chemicals, intermediates, specialty aroma chemicals, industrial chemicals and optical brighteners, plus natural antioxidants and nutraceuticals.  Back in November Koor revealed an approach by ChemChina and said the Chinese government-owned chemicals business wanted a controlling stake.  The two sides had reached preliminary understandings, Koor said, noting that the Beijing-backed firm could end up with 100.0 per cent of MA.  Two months ago Koor described the process as being in the early stages, subject to negotiation and still needing internal approval. Calcalist’s report suggests the Israeli vendor has the backing of its parent.   Shares in MA were 1.3 per cent lower at ILS 15.90 (USD 4.42) today, while IDB was down 3.6 per cent and Koor was 3.2 per cent lower.  The Omer-based target generated revenue of USD 2.22 billion last year after a 15.1 per cent decline from USD 2.61 billion in 2008.  Pre-tax earnings fell 90.4 per cent over the same timeframe, with the effect of narrowing MA’s profit margin from 10.4 per cent to 1.2 per cent.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Speculation that the state investment company may bid for the remaining 46.0 per cent stake it does not already own comes just days after the Singaporean public transport operator agreed to sell train assets to the government.  A person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg the proposal for SMRT, which has a market value of about SGD 2.40 billion (USD 1.78 billion), is still being discussed and noted there is no guarantee talks will lead to a deal.  When contacted by the news provider, both Temasek and the public transport operator said they do not comment on speculation or 0s.  Meanwhile a source with knowledge of the situation told the Wall Street Journal that a delisting would provide a way for minority shareholders to make a return on their investment at a time when the earnings outlook appears bleak.  Not only will a takeover enable investors to avoid exposure to a volatile stock price but it would allow Temasek to restructure operations and business focus, the newspaper reported.  SMRT has faced criticism over the last four years due to service disruptions while at the same time expanding its network.  At the end of last week the group said it is selling its SMRT Trains and SMRT Light Rail subsidiaries, comprising rail, signal and related assets, to the Land Transport Authority of Singapore in order to focus on improving upkeep services.  It noted the existing business structure “has become unsustainable” and that its “fare margins have been declining since financial year 2012” while operating expenses have increased due to a “maintenance regime and replacement programmes for the ageing network”.   Song Seng Wun of CIMB Private Banking told Bloomberg the asset sale will make it easier to manage the transport system.  The analyst noted the deal will reduce the SMRT’s burden of answering to shareholders as the government will address the pressure from the public.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

These sources said the company concluded it would not be able to jettison the asset for a sufficiently high price and any deal would result in significant losses being incurred.  They added that the bank is not prepared to go ahead on this basis and has called time on the mooted transaction.  News of a sale emerged in November when Vienna Stock Exchange-listed Raiffeisen Bank said it was analysing offers received for the Hungarian activities.  At the time, a spokeswoman told Reuters a number of parties in the country had expressed an interest and submitted approaches, while the group itself said it was unable to rule out the possibility that it would exit Hungary, Slovenia and Ukraine.  Earlier this week, local daily Magyar Hírlap named Szechenyi Kereskedelmi Bank as a suitor.  However, no financial details of the part state-owned lender’s bid were disclosed.  On 7th January Hungarian news provider Portfolio.hu described an agreement between the parties as likely, adding that completion could occur by the end of this year.

       " 'Miller Group, the UK’s largest privately held housebuilder, could soon become a public company as an upturn in the country’s property market begins to gather pace, according to the Financial Times (FT).  The Scottish firm’s owners, private equity firm Blackstone and the Miller family, are mulling the possibility of following other real estate companies to have floated on the stock exchange, the paper noted.  Edinburgh-based Miller is yet to hire bankers, but is predicted to do so in the next few weeks, people familiar with the matter told the FT.  Just last week, estate agent Foxtons made its public debut in an initial public offering (IPO) that raised GBP 429.00 million, and its share value has been steadily improving.  Miller specialises in housebuilding, commercial property, construction and asset management, and is the ninth largest volume home builder in the UK, operating from eight regions across the land.  It also has a mining division which participates in a joint venture with Argent Group at the country’s biggest opencast coal mine and land reclamation project at Ffos-y-fran in Wales.  Under the management of the Miller family for more than 80 years, the company generated turnover of GBP 361.50 million and profit before interest and tax of GBP 14.20 million in 2012.  Miller also had a development pipeline of 12.60 million square feet and mining reserves totalling 7.20 million tonnes.  While its housebuilding arm benefitted from an increase in consumer confidence and the government’s Funding for Lending initiative encouraging prospective buyers to take out mortgages, the company’s construction arm suffered.  The impact of a highly competitive contracting market, cost overruns and what it termed “operational issues” meant this side of the business recorded a loss, leading to a shift towards providing end-to-end property for public and private clients.  FT noted that Keith Miller has made his feelings clear about the future of the business, wishing to expand rather than be swallowed up by a rival.  After a strong set of interim results statement for the first half of the year, he observed: “We now have a strong base from which to plan for the future development of the business.”  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

In June, while announcing management changes at the majority-owned subsidiary, Geely noted the UK business sold 1,600 automobiles in 2017, representing a 10.0 per cent increase on 2016, and also showed a profit for the first time in history.   A billion-plus investment would certainly go some way towards pushing the brand into the big leagues by having the fire power to produce premium crossovers, such as sports utility vehicles, to rival the likes of Porsche.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Sea Harvest is lining up a ZAR 1.50 billion (USD 111.96 million) initial public offering (IPO) for the end of March to become one of the first black industrial companies to trade on the JSE, and the bourse’s second fishing listing of 2017.  The owner of the cape hake processor and distributor is keen to roll out a fundraiser, and share consolidation, which would dilute its own 85.0 per cent stake to roughly 52.0 per cent and intends to retain at least 50.1 per cent.  Brimstone Investment noted Sea Harvest will be able to use proceeds to repay debt of ZAR 303.00 million and in so doing strengthen its balance sheet while bulking up with capital for organic and acquisitive growth.  Expansion opportunities include boosting margins by investing in vessels, plans and operations as well as diversifying into other products and species within South Africa’s fishing sector and local food segments.  Sea Harvest will use the acquisition of a majority stake in Australian shellfish fisher and seafood wholesale holding company Mareterram in Australia as a springboard for growth in the agri-business field in that country.  While the group will gain access to the capital markets to support its growth strategy, the owner is looking upon the listing as a way of releasing equity through the redemption of preference shares and loans.  Brimstone first invested in 53-year old Sea Harvest in 1998 in exchange for an initial 10.8 per cent stake and since taking control in 2009 has injected a total ZAR 776.00 million in the firm.  The IPO hopeful is a trawler operator and fishing and vertically-integrated food business with operations in South Africa and Australia, and has retail and foodservice customers in 22 countries.  News of Sea Harvest’s venture into the capital markets for the first time comes after shareholders of African Equity Empowerment Investments approved of plans to list portfolio company Premier Food and Fishing in March.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Formula One may be on the verge of losing another team after Auto Motor und Sport reported that Switzerland-based Sauber could be merged into Marussia.  Without citing its sources, the German motor racing and automobile magazine said financial constraints could lead to the pair joining forces, a move which would see the sport reduced to ten teams in 2014, compared to the twelve who competed for the World Championship last year.  It added that Andrei Cheglakov, who owns Marussia, has grown weary of investing large sums and not seeing the results to justify his spending.  However, Schmidt added that the businessman wants to continue within Formula One and is eyeing the Swiss team after a failed approach for a share of UK-based Williams, which placed ninth in 2013’s world championship rankings.  No further details have been disclosed at this time and there is no indication of when a deal could be expected to complete and if it goes ahead, how much Cheglakov would be willing to pay for Sauber.  Sauber placed seventh in this year’s championship, which concluded on 24th November, although its best finish came in 2007 when it was ranked second.  At that time, its drivers included current world champion Sebastian Vettel, who now drives for Red Bull Racing and secured the team’s fourth consecutive championship this year.  UK-based Marussia is currently managed by Manor Motorsport and previously competed under the Virgin Racing banner following its introduction in 2010.  The team has had a turbulent season, lagging behind in tenth position after losing two of its drivers; Timo Glock departed before the season had even begun, citing commercial reasons.  He was later followed through the exit door by Luiz Razia following funding issues.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'A tie-up between the world\\'s largest aluminium producer and the global leader in nickel production is inevitable, one of the groups\\' former chairmen has claimed.  Mikhail Prokhorov, the co-owner of Moscow-based nickel and palladium producer Norilsk Nickel, told the Russian business daily Vedomosti that a merger with United Company Rusal may only be a matter of time.  Mr Prokhorov claimed his ex-partner Vladimir Potanin, who owns 25.3 per cent of Norilsk, supports the idea of creating a Russian metal mining behemoth in principle.  He explained that Norilsk\\'s prospects are \"limited\" at present and its global competitiveness will weaken as costs creep up and global rivals consolidate.  Last week the Russian entrepreneur - one of the leading industrialists in Russia\\'s precious metals sector - agreed to sell his blocking 25-per-cent-plus-one-share stake in Norilsk to Rusal in exchange for an 11 per cent interest in the enlarged capital of Rusal.  Mr Potanin has first refusal on the shares, held by Mr Prokhorov\\'s Onexim Group, and a sale to Rusal will only take place if they are not taken by Mr Potanin for USD 15.7 billion by the end of the year.  Mr Potanin therefore has the choice of whether to join a process to create a Russian diversified mining leader or buy Mr Prokhorov out of the firm.  \"I think a merger would be the best option and consolidation will happen sooner or later,\" Reuters cited the former Norilsk chairman as saying.  The combined entity would have a market value of around USD 100 billion, with USD 55.74 billion accounted for by Norilsk.  Controlled by Oleg Deripaska\\'s Basic Element investment company, Rusal is responsible for 12 per cent of the global aluminium market and accounts for 15 per cent of global aluminium production, with operations in 19 countries on 5 continents.  Its mining operations produce primary aluminium and alloys, while its processing divisions produce foil and packaging, powders and metallurgy, wire, silicon, chemical and corundum products, and gallium.  With USD 11.592 billion in 2006 revenues, Norilsk focuses on nickel, platinum, palladium and copper production, along with by-products including metallic cobalt, rhodium, silver, gold, tellurium, selenium, iridium and ruthenium.  Last year it realised 61.7 per cent sales growth from USD 7.169 billion in 2005 (FY 2004: USD 7.033 billion; FY 2003: USD 5.169 billion).  With net profit more than doubling to USD 5.989 billion, the slow-down predicted by Mr Prokhorov is by no means evident yet, and Mr Potanin has plenty to think about before Christmas.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Chevron Corporation, the number two oil company in the US, put its Pembroke refinery on the block today.  \"Downstream market conditions are likely to be difficult for the next several years,” Chevron said, noting it is “soliciting bids for certain operations in Europe”.  These include the south-west Wales site which specialises in processing heavy, lower-quality crudes and helps the US firm supply approximately 1,100 Texaco-branded service stations.  At full capacity, Pembroke can refine 220,000 barrels per day, according to its owner. It is not clear how much the asset might fetch in a sale.  “We intend to further concentrate our downstream portfolio in North America and Asia-Pacific; these are markets in which we have our greatest competitive strength,” Chevron said.  Other assets outside Europe are also for sale, including activities in the Caribbean and select Central America markets, while the oil major will review operations in Hawaii and certain parts of Africa.  Chevron and its peers have been hit by recessions in the UK and US; declining demand for fuel as economies slowed left them with too much capacity. France’s Total recently confirmed closure of a number of sites.  Refined fuels from the Pembroke facility are distributed throughout the UK and Ireland, and are also exported to international markets such as the US.  Located in south-west Wales, the refinery can produce 17 different products, including diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas.  Gasoline accounts for around half of its output – some 3.50 million gallons per day, making the refinery one of the largest of its kind in north-west Europe.  California-based Chevron suffered a 37.1 per cent decline in revenue last year from USD 273.01 billion to USD 171.64 billion.

       " \"A twist in the takeover of TDC has emerged today as a suitor proposed an acquisition that could prompt the Danish telecommunications giant to withdraw its recommendation to combine with MTG's Nordic Entertainment and Studios businesses.  The statement released this morning merely said an interested buyer has approached the former state monopoly, though “there can be no certainty that the current discussions will lead to the potential bidder making an offer”.  However, if an offer is made, then the board of directors intends to withdraw the recommendation for the poorly received USD 2.50 billion acquisition of the entertainment and studio units of MTG.  The announcement left the media outlets all aflutter on speculation of just what company has upset the apple cart, after all, TDC summarily rejected a USD 6.00 billion bid from a Macquarie-led consortium just last week.  While the “potential bidder” was not named in the statement, it has not stopped analysts from suggesting a rival telecoms operator like Telia of Sweden may have stepped forward.  Financial details were not disclosed either, though Morten Imsgard of Sydbank told Reuters he expects TDC’s board would only accept a bid that tops DKK 50.00 apiece (USD 8.23).  Shares in the group were up 6.5 per cent by 13:18 local time today at DKK 46.45, just shy of the reported DKK 47.00 apiece offer tabled by the Macquarie-led consortium.

The El Dorado-based enterprise owns plants in Wisconsin, Louisiana and Wales, and has been operating in the UK since 1960 under the Murco name.  Some analysts were unsure as to the wisdom of the sale, according to Reuters. Marc Gilman of the Benchmark Company, quoted by the news provider, described the current climate as difficult for offloading assets.   Pritchard Capital Partners’ Ray Deacon, also cited by Reuters, thought Murphy could hope to get at least USD 1.50 billion for the activities.  The company stated it expects to close the sale in the first quarter of 2011.  It appears that performance of the operations has been unimpressive in comparison to Murphy’s exploration and production (E&P) and US retail activities.  President and chief executive David Wood said: “Murphy’s upstream and US retail businesses have demonstrated marked growth and financial performance over the last several years. By exiting the refining business, we can fully focus our attention and resources on continuing that growth.”  The company reported E&P income of USD 247.00 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to USD 50.30 million in Q1 2009. This was due to both higher sales prices for crude oil, lower exploration expenses and greater volumes of natural gas, among other factors.   In contrast, Murphy’s refining and marketing (R&M) business made a Q1 2010 loss of USD 29.70 million, where it had earned USD 10.80 million a year earlier. US R&M activities accounted for a Q1 2010 loss of USD 14.70 million against a profit of USD 14.60 million in Q1 2009.  Refining margins for Q1 2010 were described as very weak by the company.  In 2007 a federal judge approved a settlement of USD 330.00 million by Murphy to homeowners whose properties were flooded with crude oil after Hurricane Katrina swept a storage tank off its foundation at the Meraux, Louisiana refinery.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

       " 'TPG and General Atlantic are 0ed to have exited Hong Kong-based personal computer manufacturer Lenovo for HKD 1.54 billion (USD 198.65 million).  Sources told Bloomberg the pair sold 282.30 million shares in the laptop, notebook and desktop manufacturer at HKD 5.45 apiece, the low end of a marked range.  There has not yet been a public announcement so the source did not wish to be identified.  Yesterday Reuters said the price had been set between HKD 5.45 and HKD 5.53, but gave no indication that the stock had been sold.  Nomura is the sole bookrunner for the offering, which represents a 1.4 per cent discount at the bottom end of the range.  TPG and General Atlantic are exiting more than five years after they initially backed Lenovo; together with Newbridge Capital they invested HKD 2.73 billion in May 2005.  TPG, then known as Texas Pacific Group, acquired a 5.9 per cent interest, while Newbridge got 1.5 per cent and General Atlantic bought almost 3.0 per cent.  In November 2007 the three US private equity firms sold a combined 4.1 per cent stake for HKD 2.86 billion.  DBS Vickers analyst Steven Zhang told the Wall Street Journal it is likely that TPG and General Atlantic are just cashing out.  Lenovo managed a turnaround in the 12 months to March 2010, generating net earnings of USD 129.37 million from USD 226.39 million net loss in financial 2009, and its share price has increased by more than a fifth since August.  Sales were 12.0 per cent higher at USD 16.69 billion in 2010, almost returning to pre-crisis levels (FY 2009: USD 14.90 billion; FY 2008: USD 16.87 billion) and pushing earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation up almost threefold from USD 132.75 million to USD 388.16 million.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " \"Spanish building constructor Jale Construcciones SA is being targeted for investment by up to three venture capital companies, La Voz de Cadiz has reported today.  It is not known how much any of the three parties are willing to pump into the Malaga-based firm, or how much equity is wanted in exchange.  The article claims that of the three potential financiers, only one is Spanish with the other two having overseas operations.   Jale managed to steadily increase its turnover from EUR 16.807 million in fiscal 2002 to EUR 26.629 million by 2005 but these gradual improvements were eclipsed by a 60 per cent jump to EUR 42.617 million the following year.  Despite the massive improvement in its top line, the increased revenue failed to filter down to the company's net figures, with Jale generating a profit of EUR 370,855. This figure was up just 4 per cent on 2005's earnings of EUR 356,459 and reflected that Jale's thin profit margin had tightened from 2.1 per cent to just 1.33 per cent during FY 2006. Figures for FY 2007 are not available yet.  The majority of the company's work is undertaken domestically in western and eastern Andalucía as well as Levante, although Jale has been in enterprises in Poland and Germany.  The group engages in most elements of building construction from residential to non-residential as well as undertaking civil engineering and infrastructure projects.   Jale more than trebled its workforce between 2002 and 2006 from 44 to 135 but the company has yet to comment on whether the opening of its shareholder register to venture capital investors is part of its expansion plans.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Life Healthcare is set to invest up to INR 7.90 billion (USD 131.56 million) to raise its holding in an Indian hospital chain, according to its partner in the venture.  In a stock exchange filing, Max India said it will sell up to a 13.3 per cent stake in Max Healthcare at INR 67.50 per share to the South African group.  The hospital operator will also issue INR 3.97 billion in new stock to Life Healthcare to further increase its equity interest.  At present, Max India has overall control of Max Healthcare with 65.9 per cent of the shares, with Life Healthcare owning 26.0 per cent, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) 7.5 per cent and the balance is in the hands of employees in the form of options.  The transaction is aimed at balancing out the shareholding in the joint venture between the two partners so that both hold an equal stake.  IFC has the right to convert a portion of preference shares to maintain its 7.5 per cent holding, and/or exercise a so-called tag along option to coincide with the sale of equity by Max India.  Once a formal agreement has been signed the transaction will need to be rubber-stamped by regulators.  Max Healthcare operates 12 hospitals across northern India with an emphasis on high-end tertiary and quaternary care.  Its 2,100 doctors and 9,300 support staff undertake all types of major surgery, infertility and IVF treatment, cancer and oncological services and cosmetic procedures.  Last year the company embarked on a major expansion drive, launching four new facilities in Delhi-NCR and north India to almost double capacity to approaching 2,000 beds.  In fiscal 2014 Max Healthcare generated revenues of INR 14.07 million, a 22.0 per cent increase year-on-year, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation grew by 59.0 per cent over the same period to INR 1.13 billion.

Sources suggested that while state-owned Shanghai Electric and private equity firm AGIC Capital both tested the waters early on, industrial robotics and auto automation equipment maker Jiangsu Hagong Intelligent Robot (HIT) may be the most serious bidder.  Reuters noted the auction of FFT, a provider of turnkey manufacturing facilities for car makers, comes as the European Union tightened regulations regarding foreign corporate takeovers involving the movement of vital technology abroad.  Meanwhile, China has shifted its focus of foreign investment directly on technology to help support home-grown companies operating in areas like biotechnology and pharmaceutical, fintech and machine learning, for example.  Reuters added FFT represents an opportunity for HIT to acquire advanced technology that would boost high-end manufacturing.  The Chinese group recently changed its name following a major asset restructuring to focus on making smart industrial automation systems and equipment.  Its aim is to become a one-stop-shop platform offering artificial intelligence applications that can be used across a range of industries.  FFT is touted as a global provider of turnkey automated and flexible production systems: from single cells to interlinked manufacturing plants.  In terms of automation services, the company offers project management, hard- and software development, switch cabinet construction and installation, and off- and online robot programming, among other things.  Automobile and Tier 1 customers include the likes of Audi, Chrysler, TATA and Dalian while other clients range from Airbus, Bosch and Johnson Controls to Linde, Miele and ThyssenKrupp.  Reuters noted FFT is likely to have a valuation of 8x to 10x expected 2017 core earnings of roughly EUR 60.00 million.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Talks with the banks are still going, this person said, while a separate source close to VNU revealed 3i has already ruled out a cash injection – a claim denied by Britain’s oldest buyout group.  Riverhill will advise on the debt restructuring of VNU, the Times said.  The group has leading recruitment and IT titles in the Netherlands, including the top graduate jobs website Intermediaironline.nl and the broader-focused Nationalevacaturebank.nl, which claims to publish the largest number of vacancies.  It has been hit by falling advertising revenue and the cost of transferring print titles online.   VNU previously published Accountancy Age in the UK but 3i sold the title to Incisive Media in 2007 with the exit of VNU Business Publications.   Sources close to 3i told the Times that the fund wants to put more money into VNU because it believes it to be a strong business, however, the move has not yet been put to the 3i credit committee.

The Luxembourg-registered online communications firm did not say how much it is paying, but the Telegraph newspaper suggested it could be around USD 80.00 million.  Skype, which is in the process of being acquired by Microsoft, is looking to secure its space in the increasingly competitive market for group messaging.  Facebook bought Beluga, a major rival of GroupMe, for an undisclosed sum in March this year and has since launched a new instant messaging application.  “The acquisition of GroupMe complements Skype's leadership in voice and video communications by providing best-in-class text-based communications and innovative features that enable users to connect, share locations and photos and make plans with their closest ties,” it said.  Founded last year, New York-based GroupMe is a free group messaging service which allows users to send text messages and photos to selected groups from their existing contacts lists.   It touts itself as a “private chat room that works on any phone” and its software is free to download.    Early backers included First Round Capital, Betaworks, SV Angel and Lerer Ventures, and together with several angel investors, these firms provided USD 0.85 million of financing almost exactly a year ago.  In January 2011 they were joined by Khosla Ventures and General Catalyst Partners for a second round of funding worth USD 10.60 million.  Skype's chief executive Tony Bates said GroupMe is “a perfect addition to the voice, video and text products in the Skype family”.  Cited by the Telegraph, he said the group messaging segment is “very important”.  GroupMe was founded last year by Jared Hecht, a Columbia University graduate who formerly worked for blog hosting platform Tumblr, and Steve Martocci, a serial entrepreneur who founded email marketing firm Sympact Technologies and ticketing platform Bandwith.us.  It was inspired by a project conceived at the 2010 TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon, during which 300 hackers worked together on a variety of projects ahead of the TechCrunch Disrupt conference.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

The companies under scrutiny are Shanghai Stock Exchange-quoted Dazhong Transportation Group and smaller rival Jinjiang, which is controlled by Jin Jiang Group, China's largest hotel operator.  Dazhong is the largest taxi company in the city managing around 9,000 taxis while Jinjiang has a fleet of around 4,000.  Reuters said the consolidation of the taxi services industry is due to vulnerability in the face of fuel price volatility. The central government raised fuel prices by about 20 per cent in June.  The Shanghai government controls the Jin Jiang Group. Jin Jiang Hotels is the core of the group and operates more than 380 hotels and inns affiliated to it.  Earlier this year Dazhong entered into talks with quoted Shanghai Haibo over purchasing the latter’s taxi business which had been valued at CNY 1.65 billion (GBP 135.05 million). The acquisition would have swelled Dazhong’s taxi unit to 14,000 taxis, surpassing the operations of Shanghai Qiangsheng Holding and Shanghai Bashi Industrial Group, two local players with combined fleet operations of 13,000 taxis. \\t Dazhong had total assets of CNY 9.97 billion at the end of December 2007 and had increased its operating revenue 12.5 per cent to CNY 5.78 billion from CNY 5.14 billion the previous year.

In a statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, Delek said it is considering joining a tender to buy the assets, though there is no certainty it will make an offer.  The purchase would be part of its global expansion – Delek is particularly keen to increase fuel storage capacity – and would be effected via a subsidiary.  According to Haaretz, the would-be buyer might spend “hundreds of millions of euros on the transaction”.  The paper said Shell has already issued a tender for assets belonging to its Greek operation Shell Hellas and is seeking EUR 1.00 billion from their sale.   Citing industry sources it did not name, the report suggested the UK-based fuel major is looking to exit some of the 700 petrol stations it manages in Greece because of excess supply pushing down volume sales at individual sites.  Since Shell does not own most of the stations it operates, Delek would be unlikely to offer more than EUR 350.00 million, Haaretz said.  Greece's national energy company Motor Oil might bid in competition with the Israeli firm, potentially pushing up the price.  Palaio Faliro-based Shell Hellas generated EUR 1.65 billion in 2007 revenue and posted a net income of EUR 32.20 million.  The unit achieved unbroken sales growth in records stretching between 1998 and 2007 and doubled the figure over the nine-year period.

Chairman Floris Deckers, in a statement to Euronext yesterday, said the holding company intends to dispose of the business in due course – its investment in the Gravenhage-based firm is not of a strategic nature.  Van Lanschot assumed control of Robein Leven on 10th August after the insurer’s shareholder had pledged stock as collateral for a loan.  The investor, which was not identified by Deckers, was faced with the prospect of defaulting and decided to transfer the securities instead of failing, Reuters reported.  In an interview with the news provider, Deckers said Robein Leven is not a perfect fit for Van Lanschot and he will sell it off \"as soon as we can find someone who will pay us what we put into it\".  He also told the news provider he is currently working with auditors to see if it is possible to hold the subsidiary for sale without consolidating its results.  Founded in 1981, Robein Leven is an independent life insurance company. Its wholly-owned subsidiary Robein Bank, is a boutique private lender.

Of the 20-plus expressions of interest in Investa, nearly half came from Asia, including China’s biggest privately-owned conglomerate Fosun International and sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation, the source told Reuters.   Bids will be shortlisted ahead of a final deadline of 31st May, the person added, asking not to be named as the sale process is confidential.  Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while Fosun and CIC did not immediately respond to an emailed request for reaction from Reuters.  UBS and Morgan Stanley are running the auction, which also attracted bids from the US and South Africa, as well as drawing local interest, the source said.  The Business Spectator named Blackstone, CBRE and Charter Hall as among those to have made offers.  With AUD 9.00 billion of assets under management, Investa Property is one of Australia’s largest office management companies and is also active in residential and industrial land development.  In the 12 months to 31st December 2014, profits leapt 80.9 per cent to AUD 99.50 million from AUD 56.00 million in FY 2013 and net property income increased 12.2 per cent year-on-year from AUD 85.40 million to AUD 95.80 million.  Funds from operations rose slightly to AUD 87.30 million (FY 2013: AUD 84.50 million) over the same timeframe.  Morgan Stanley began the sale process for Investa Property in February and 50 parties requested due diligence on the business, the source told Reuters.  This number had almost halved by the time it came to submitting first-round bids.  Another person told the news provider the sale is expected to take until the end of the year before it is 1.  Morgan Stanley may also consider splitting Investa Property and selling it off piecemeal, this source added.    © Zephus Ltd',\n",

These sources said that Morgan Stanley has been hired to gauge interest from potential suitors, but no formal sale process has yet begun.  One of the people added that IK Investment Partners is seeking to sell the business by the end of the year, and interest is expected to be generated among both strategic and private equity investors.  Based in Darmstadt and established over 130 years ago, Schenck Process offers measuring and process technology products for weighing in sectors such as cement, gravel and non-ferrous metals, chemicals and food, mining and coal-fired power plants.   Products range from machines for feeding powdered materials and meal, plastics granulation equipment and train loaders for the rail industry.  It has won awards for its weighing, feeding, screening and automation solutions, winning the Frost & Sullivan award for two consecutive years.   The group operates in 33 locations globally, has 3,000 employees around the world, and achieves revenues in excess of EUR 500.00 million according to the company’s website.   IK Investment Partners acquired the business from HgCapital in a secondary buyout in 2007, and subsequently added on Australian concern Screenex in 2008, Clyde Process Solutions in the UK, and Brazil’s Pentec Industrial, the latter two both in 2011.   One of Reuter’s sources commented that while trade buyers such as Siemens and General Electric may be interested in the Schenck sale, private equity houses were more likely to bid for the company.

Two people with knowledge of the matter told the broadsheet the Parisian genome engineering firm is in negotiations for a deal, but cautioned there is no certainty an agreement will be reached.   Pfizer, which already holds a 9.5 per cent stake in Cellectis, made an informal approach that could value the target at as much as EUR 1.50 billion, according to one source.   It is not yet clear which, if any, other buyers are involved in sale talks with the French firm. Neither it, nor Pfizer, made any comment when contacted by the FT.   Cellectis is a gene-editing company focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene-edited engineered Car-T cells, including its flagship Talen technology, which can be used as targetable DNA “scissors” to enable insertion, deletion, repair and replacement in living cells.  Founded in 1999 and headed by André Choulika, the firm floated on Euronext Paris in 2007 and raised USD 228.00 million in a secondary listing on Nasdaq in March this year.   Pfizer acquired a stake in Cellectis in 2014 as part of a partnership between the two aimed at developing cancer treatments.   A takeover of the French company would further boost the New York drug maker’s bid to expand its presence in the emerging immune-oncology segment, following a tie-up with Germany’s Merck last year.  Shares in Cellectis leapt more than 14.0 per cent at USD 46.89 yesterday following the FT report, giving it a market capitalisation of USD 1.60 billion.   In February Pfizer bought sterile injectable drugs maker Hospira for USD 17.00 billion.  The US group has been busying itself with a string of acquisitions after a failed takeover bid for UK pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca last year, although the FT observed there are 0s it may try again.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Banca Farmafactoring provides credit management and non-recourse factoring services to suppliers in the Italian and Iberian public sectors.   It purchases and oversees the collection of receivables on behalf of clients, allowing them to fully outsource management of their invoicing.  The Milan-headquartered firm also provides non-recourse factoring for customers who choose not to retain them on their own balance sheets and in Italy it additionally operates in the retail deposit market.  Apax acquired Banca Farmafactoring in late 2006 when it was solely active in its home country.  Under the private equity firm’s auspices, it has grown to serve Spain and Portugal and obtained a full banking licence in 2013.  In February Banca Farmafactoring said its shareholders were examining strategic options for their stakes in the company, including an initial public offering.  The announcement followed reports by Italian media late last year that buyout houses Blackstone, Cinven and Permira were interested in purchasing a slice of the business.

Although no price has been attached to the capital increase, the stock will be put on sale at no less than the average price of its Shanghai-listed A shares in the previous 20 trading days before 17th July.  According to analysts, the offering could rack up CNY 23.78 billion (GBP 2.12 billion).   Peng Yulong, an analyst at Guotai Junan Securities, told the Wall Street Journal: \"China Pacific\\'s Hong Kong IPO will give Carlyle the flexibility to reduce the size of its investment.”  Meanwhile, sources told Reuters Carlyle – which holds around 17.0 per cent of China Pacific – is unlikely to sell its entire holding but may dispose of a small portion after the IPO.  The share sale is dependent on market conditions and on obtaining a green light from stakeholders and the country’s regulators.  China Pacific had previously hoped to sell up to 900.00 million securities in Hong Kong at a price that would not be below the group’s December 2007 Shanghai debut of CNY 30.00 per unit.   However, volatile market conditions brought on by the financial tsunami made the group ditch its plans.  China Pacific, the People’s Republic’s third largest life insurer by premiums after China Life Insurance and Ping An Insurance of China, booked an 80.6 per cent slump in net profit to CNY 1.34 billion in fiscal 2008 (FY 2007: CNY 6.89 billion).

The consideration comprises GBP 58.00 million in cash and an earn-out of up to GBP 56.00 million in relation to the achievement of certain performance objectives.   Closing is expected by the end of this month.   News Corp’s chief executive Robert Thomson said: “Unruly complements our traditional editorial and commercial expertise with contemporary insight into how people read, watch, buy and sell in the digital era.”  Claiming to be the leading programmatic platform for social video advertising, the UK company offers ShareRank, a proprietary technology capable of predicting the virality of content across social media.   Currently Unruly employs 200 staff across 15 offices in London, New York and Singapore.   The acquisition provides an exit opportunity for Amadeus Capital Partners, Endeit Capital and Business Growth Fund, which have backed the company since 2012.  Upon completion, the start-up will operate as a separate business unit and report to Rebekah Brooks, who returned to News Corp earlier this month as the chief executive of its UK news division.   Brooks was involved in a phone-hacking scandal and subsequently cleared of all charges last year.

Novera, which is trying to fend off a takeover offer for its entire operations from Infinis, said prior to receiving the bid it had begun assessing interest in the cleantech assets.  “We have received a number of expressions of interest and the board is encouraged by the level of indicative offers received, it said in a stock exchange announcement, noting that it expects to complete the process in early 2010.  The group has a site in Mynydd Clogau in Wales with a 15.00 MW capacity from 17 turbines and another wind farm at Lisset airfield in Yorkshire which can produce 30.00 MW from 12 turbines.  Its portfolio under planning includes another 19-turbine site in Mynydd Clogau, as well as a 12.50 MW farm in Bullamoor, North Yorkshire and an 8.00 MW wind farm in Todd Hill, Northumberland.  London-registered Novera would use funds from investment in one of its operational sites to finance up-and-coming projects.   It has struggled this year against frozen credit markets but today said debt availability in the UK wind market has improved.  In fact it used “beneficial new developments” in the sector – and the progress it is making in this area – as its reasoning for rebuffing the takeover bid from Terra Firma-backed Infinis.  Founded in 1998, Novera works across the renewable energy segment, generating power at 58 sites across the UK and has a total capacity of 143.00 MW.   It was worth GBP 35.51 million in 2008 revenue after an annual increase of 10.4 per cent (FY 2007: GBP 32.17 million; FY 2006: GBP 2.18 million).

       " 'UK-based Coller Capital, the leading global investor in private equity secondaries, is interested in purchasing Natixis Private Equity (NPE), sources with knowledge of the matter told Age Fi.  The finance publication said Coller has hired Close Brothers to study NPE’s dossier, though the French buyout group is not officially for sale.  Its suitor acquires investments in funds before their maturity, allowing existing backers to cash out, and offering partners the chance to exit by taking on the funds’ remaining assets.  It could come up against a major obstacle – the French investment banking group Natixis refusing to sell its private equity unit – Age Fi noted.  Certain NPE funds invest around a quarter of their commitments in private equity secondaries.  Laurent Mignon, who became chief executive of the parent company earlier this year, would rather not exit this segment, the report said. It could, after all, be set for strong growth.  An industry source told Age Fi there may be problems relating to the issue of NPE’s dossier as it is not in Natixis’s interest to reveal private information.  The secondary market is being used to secure distressed assets at a discount presents vast opportunities for fund managers, according to Troy Duncan, portfolio manager at JPMorgan Private Equity.  “The secondary approach allows us to go into the life cycle of private equity funds and buy assets that are working, such as healthcare and education,” Duncan told the Financial Times earlier this week.  NPE focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) worth between EUR 50.00 million and EUR 500.00 million and leads its domestic market for private equity investments in SMEs.  Last year it had EUR 4.02 million of managed capital, more than a third of which was outside France.

       " \"Rediff.com India, the operator of the country's third-largest internet portal, saw its share price rise 33 per cent last week on speculation that it is negotiating a takeover with several global internet firms.   Shares in the Nasdaq-listed site, which specialises in news, information, entertainment and shopping, rose from a close of USD 19.14 on Monday (July 9) to close at USD 25.41 on Friday (July 13), compared to a consistent close of between USD 17 and USD 18 in May and June.  Apparently US search engine Google is measuring up the Mumbai-headquartered firm, which is worth USD 477 million and USD 13 million in terms of market capitalisation and revenue respectively.  Google's US rival Yahoo Inc., along with Time Warner division AOL and Microsoft's MSN portal, could also join the fray in a deal which analysts claim could be worth USD 1,000 million.  While internet services and media company AOL is not a significant player in the Indian market, it could be looking to compliment its strong presence in offshore services from the country, the Hindustan Times said, noting the growth potential for internet penetration in urban areas.  Google is currently on the acquisition trail, saying last week it would be interest in talks with US-based social networking site Facebook, while Yahoo has been touted as a suitor for both Facebook and rival US social network site Bebo. Both deals carry a similar USD 1,000 price tag.  Acquiring an undisclosed stake in Bangalore transliteration software company Tachyon Technologies last year, and more recently launching a website to allow users to upload voice, video and photographic content free of charge, Rediff has a firm hold on the Indian internet services market - valued by MarketResearch.com at USD 548 million at the end of 2006. It also has interests in the US publishing sector.  However, this statistic throws the Rediff USD 1,000 million deal value into question; would a firm be worth double the potential value of its market?  Reuters quoted US finance newspaper Barron's as claiming the Rediff's stock is overpriced, noting that its market capitalisation is more than 13 times higher than estimates from the Indian online advertising market - the origin of most of its revenues.  Meanwhile, web information company Alexa recorded a 28 per cent drop in the portal's traffic over the last three months. A figure supported by Barron's, which said the group is losing its foothold as Google and Yahoo enter the Indian market.  With total revenues for its India operations standing at USD 6.269 million for the first quarter of 2007 - up 76 per cent year-on-year and 11 per cent on the previous quarter - Rediff recorded USD 2.013 million in net income before tax. The company makes an established target for the US companies, but it remains to be seen whether they would prefer to go it alone.\",\n",

The management of the Pavilion Theatre in Glasgow has offered to take over the running of the 106-year-old Ayr-based building but has been rebuffed by the South Ayrshire Council, the owners of the playhouse, the Herald reported. \\t Iain Gordon, general manager of the Pavilion Theatre, told the Herald: \"We had a meeting with the council in July and I thought it was a very positive meeting. We felt we could run it and take it off their hands but we have not heard from them since.”  He went on to say that Equity, the Scottish Music Hall and Variety Theatre Society, and the Theatre Trust all wished to help save the theatre.  In order for actors to carry on treading the boards around GBP 4.50 million for renovation costs needs to be pumped into the theatre.  A public meeting is set to take place to contest the controversial decision to close the stage as it is a much-loved addition to the Scottish town.  One of the organisers of the public gathering, Ayrshire Arts Network\\'s Caroline Lorimar, told the Ayrshire Post: \"We are hoping to get good representation from the council at this meeting.  \"It is an opportunity for people to air their view, show solidarity and to tell the council that we do mind what happens to the Gaiety.\"  The fear is that should the theatre close it may be unlikely to open again. The debate surrounding the possible closure is warming people up in the Scottish town situated on the Firth of Clyde.  Provost Sloan believes the final curtain on the theatre will lead to a cultural vacuum in Ayr. She told the Ayrshire Post: “The Gaiety is part of our cultural heritage. If we lose it we will be turning our backs on the arts in Ayr. Lots of well-known artists have started their careers there.”  The Ayr playhouse, which was built in 1902, has survived two fires, one in 1903, only a year after it was built, and another in 1955.   It has endured a threat of demolition in 1972 and has gone on to host a variety of shows from pantomimes and dramas to opera and ballet.  Jazz violinist Stephane Grappelli has played on stage while Scottish comedians, such as Dave Willis and Harry Gordon, have had audiences rolling in their seats.  The theatre is to host its final two shows, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and I Robert Burns, before the final curtain falls.  Only time will tell if the Gaiety Theatre, only one of a number of old playhouses in Scotland, will pass through this uproar unscathed and renovated.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

It also pointed to Jindal’s troubles at home, including difficulty in obtaining new iron ore permits and accusations that it manipulated coal mine allotments by the government.  Earlier this week Reuters reported the New Delhi-based group aims to quadruple steel output by 2016 after opening new production plants in India and Oman to capitalise on the domestic infrastructure boom, and noted it is also in talks for mining assets in Namibia and Sharma.  Jindal had been in negotiations to take over publicly listed Affero Mining, a Canada-based, Cameroon-focused gold and steel explorer, but the target turned down the suitor’s offer and the discussions ended.  A report by Sucden Financial in April showed that the global steel industry is oversupplied while demand is weak which is driving down prices.

       " 'The Portuguese government’s privatisation of the country’s leading oil and gas firm Galp Energia appears to be moving ahead, with Jornal de Negócios today claiming it is considering exiting its 7.0 per cent stake.  Lisbon-based Galp was formed in 1999 as part of energy industry restructuring that brought together state refining and distributing monopoly Petrogal and the gas import and transport business Gás de Portugal.  It is the leading oil producer in its domestic market, and also has assets in natural gas supply and distribution, as well as power generating.   The group was worth EUR 15.18 billion in 2008 revenue and generated net earnings of EUR 116.97 million.  Back in 2006 Portugal sold Galp shares in an initial public offering which raised EUR 1.11 billion and involved a 23.0 per cent stake in the company.  This followed a deal in 2003 with the electricity utility Redes Energéticas Nacionais, which bought an 18.3 per cent Galp interest from state-owned bank Caixa Geral de Depósitos and the government.  Last month Brazilian energy minister Edison Lobao was cited by Bloomberg as saying the country’s state-controlled oil producer Petrobras is in talks to buy part of Galp.  Petrobras denied the speculation in a regulatory filing that said it is always looking for investment opportunities at home and abroad but in this case “there is no ongoing negotiation”.  Lobao was quoted by Bloomberg as saying: “It is a possibility. They want to sell a stake.”  Meanwhile, Gianna Bern, president of energy investment adviser Brookshire Advisory & Research, told the news provider “it could be a match made in heaven”. The pair are partners at more than 50 exploration blocks in Brazil.  Shares in Galp were 0.8 per cent higher at EUR 11.73 this afternoon, giving a market cap of EUR 9.05 billion.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

       " 'Indian matchmaking website Bharat Matrimony is gearing up to hit the public markets later this year in an initial public offering (IPO) that may be worth up to USD 125.00 million, people in the know told the Times of India (ToI).  The paper noted that Consim Info, which operates the site and counts US private equity firm Bessemer Venture Partners as an investor, could be valued at between USD 350.00 million and USD 450.00 million based on a share sale that would raise between USD 100.00 million to USD 125.00 million.  ToI added that Citigroup, JM Financial and Deutsche Bank are pitching to lead the offering.  In addition to Bharat Matrimony, Chennai-headquartered Consim Info operates a number of other websites, including IndiaProperty.com and social initiatives such as BharatBloodBank, which connects blood donors throughout India, and AbilityMatrimony, a matchmaking service for people with special needs.  In October 2011 Bessemer joined the company’s existing backers Mayfield Fund and Canaan Partners in buying a collective 12.0 per cent stake from Yahoo! for INR 1.00 billion (USD 18.64 million), valuing the internet business at around USD 180.00 million.  The US search giant first picked up its shareholding three years earlier, when it took part in an USD 11.75 million funding round along with the two private equity firms.  ToI noted that among Bharat Matrimony’s rivals are shaadi.com operated by People Interactive, which is backed by Westbridge Capital Partners and Sequoia Capital.  Other competitors include jeevansathi.com, owned by listed-group Info Edge, which held a domestic IPO that raised USD 39.00 million.    However, ToI noted that relatively few home-grown internet companies have gone on to become public companies.  According to one analyst, Indian stock market investors look for a steady history of profitability; this is in contrast to the Facebook IPO, when a lack of information about the group’s financial situation and profit history did little to deter would-be shareholders.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Another person with knowledge of the talks told Reuters that the transaction could be announced later today.  Founded in 2003, Labco claims to be a leading player in the European medical diagnostics field with more than 160 laboratories across 7 countries in the region, serving around 20.00 million patients a year.   In 2014, it reported revenue of EUR 650.00 million, the majority of which came from France, where the company currently runs 64 facilities.   On 7th April Labco announced an initial public offering on Euronext to raise around EUR 474.00 million, a transaction which was recently put off due to volatility in global financial markets.

Thailand’s largest retailer Central Group has a pole position as it already owns a quarter of Big C Supercenter, the country’s second-biggest discount grocery store, Reuters reported.  Bankers observed that the shopping giant has been keen to acquire Casino’s 58.6 per cent stake, worth around USD 3.10 billion at market prices, for some time.  The company’s wholly-owned Big C Vietnam unit is valued at between USD 800.00 million and USD 1.00 billion, the sources told Reuters, asking not to be identified as the matter is still private.  One person close to the situation added the interested suitors will have to pay a large amount to overtake Central or they will have to co-exist.  Another banker said the Casino would like to sell both units to the same buyer, which could also be Japanese retail conglomerate Aeon.  Thailand-based business mogul Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi is the most suitable bidder to compete against Central, Reuters noted.  Berli Jucker Public, the retail arm of the tycoon’s TCC Group, told the news provider the company is interested in the Vietnam unit and may also consider making an offer for the Thai division.

China Business News said the acquisition is expected to be signed off tomorrow, though it is not clear how much the deal is actually worth, and noted it is the country’s latest attempt to consolidate its fragmented automobile industry.  Fujian Motor was established in 1992 and is fully controlled by the government of China's south eastern Fujian province.  The group has five vehicle manufacturing subsidiaries.  South East Fujian Motor is a joint venture with Mitsubishi Motors and Taiwan's Yulon Motor while Fujian Benz Automotive counts Daimler Vans Hong Kong as a shareholder.  NLM Motor and Fujian New Forta Automobile Industry are home-grown automobile manufacturers, as is bus maker Xiamen King Long Motor.    China is large, important and has succeeded in a number of areas, capturing markets ranging from refrigerators to consumer goods.  However, there is a glaring exception: it has just not managed to crack into the West’s automobile industry and remains largely overlooked at home.   This is a bit of a pickle for a country that is counted as one of the world’s largest producers and consumers of passenger cars and light trucks.  According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, the People’s Republic made 19.27 million vehicles in 2012, up 4.3 per cent year-on-year, and left the US trailing in its wake with a mere 10.30 million.  Meanwhile, exports by domestic producers topped the one million mark for the first time last year, rising 29.7 per cent over the 12 months to 1.06 million, compared to just 19,000 in 2011, but about 1.13 million foreign-made cars were imported during the period.  While China’s industry players have achieved significant success in recent years, they are still lagging behind in their ability to compete with international rivals.   Perception is just one of the problems, as domestic consumers are smitten with foreign cars, opting for brands which enjoy a reputation for quality.  © Zephus Ltd\",\n",

Hyundai will sell part of the stake to a special-purpose acquisition vehicle formed by Hyundai Merchant Marine and Orix.  The leasing, lending and real estate conglomerate has been looking to expand abroad; the population of Japan is falling, limiting the growth potential of its businesses, Bloomberg noted. Makarim Salman of Jefferies Group told the news provider Orix could see synergies with its renting and logistics units.  He added the financial services company is looking to grow through investments in Asia.  Hyundai Logistics was founded in 1988 and has subsidiaries worldwide, including China, Vietnam, the UK, Germany and the US.  According to Orbis, the company database published by Bureau van Dijk, the group posted operating revenue of USD 1.28 billion in the financial year ended 31st December 2013, a 58.8 per cent increase on USD 803.42 million the previous 12 months.  Parent group Hyundai Merchant Marine was founded in 1976 with capital of KRW 200.00 million.   It is headed by chief executive Lee Suk-Hui, who was appointed in 2011.  Hyundai Merchant Marine generated revenues of KRW 2.08 billion in the three months ended 31st March 2014, a 16.7 per cent increase on KRW 1.28 billion in Q1 2013.  In 2011 it was reported that Hyundai Logistics could list on the Korean Stock Exchange, but the deal fell through later that year.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

       " 'Spanish health and diet products retailer Naturhouse is planning to go for an initial public offering (IPO) in which it hopes to secure funds to ramp up its franchise network to more than 40 countries, according to a report by Expansión.  Citing market sources, the business daily said a share sale could happen in the first week of November and raise around EUR 100.00 million, valuing the Llobregat-based company at roughly EUR 400.00 million.  Reuters subsequently confirmed the Expansión report, with a source telling the news provider that the retailer will sell 20.0 to 30.0 per cent of its capital mainly to institutional investors.  Naturhouse is the latest of a string of companies seeking to tap into a resurgence in the Spanish IPO market after a lengthy economic slump, with testing services group Applus and travel website operator Edreams Odigeo both debuting this year.  Airport operator Aena is also expected to float in a EUR 1.40 billion part-privatisation in November.  Expansión said Santander, Société Générale and CaixaBank have been hired as coordinators to the offering, which will take place on the Mercado Continuo and not the Mercado Alternativo Bursátil, despite the relatively small size of the transaction.  Naturhouse operates a network of 1,890 outlets in 24 countries, the majority of which are franchised.  The business is headed by Felix Revuelta and controlled by his family through holding company Kiluva, an online retailer of dietary products.  While Naturhouse has scaled back its presence in Spain it is looking to expand in new overseas markets, with a recent announcement that it plans to open 700 stores in Colombia with a local partner.  The retailer reported turnover of almost EUR 200.00 million last year, but sources told Expansión this does not reflect the company’s current situation.  Naturhouse has registered an IPO application with Spanish regulator Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, and a prospectus detailing the pricing and timetable of the offering will be filed in the coming days, people familiar with the matter told the paper.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'The boom of the previous years and the subsequent economic contraction has placed DLF, India’s largest real estate company, in a tight corner.  In order to ride out the liquidity crisis and challenging market conditions the Gurgaon-based company said it will focus on “unlocking non-strategic assets with no medium-term utility”.   The firm may find it difficult to find willing, cash-flush buyers in this current financial and economic climate, though if any are around then they could snap up some assets at bargain-prices.  DLF has also decided to focus on its cash flows in the short and medium-term rather than growth. It will also look to substitute short-term debt with asset-backed long-term obligations.  Rajiv Singh, vice chairman, said: “The present situation is very different from the boom that we had been seeing in the past few years.   “The real estate industry has moved from a period of abundant capital availability to times of liquidity crisis.   “The current economic environment has affected sentiments at a macro level, with demand from both home buyers as well as corporate [firms] being affected.”  Adverse market sentiment in the real estate sector has hit DLF’s top-and bottom-line results.  The firm recorded consolidated revenue of INR 15.03 billion (GBP 212.28 million) in the third quarter ended 31st December 2008, compared to INR 36.51 billion in the corresponding quarter Q3 2008.

SNCF could take a stake of around 49 per cent in Ferrovie Nord Cargo from FNM, Italy\\'s second-largest train operator.  The French firm has made no secret of its intentions to expand internationally, particularly into the freight and logistics sector. It has also been linked with a bid Hungarian state-owned rail freight company MAV Cargo during the last year whilst the FT article also suggested that it may look at the freight unit of Romania\\'s national rail operator CFR Marfa.  The potential transaction is unlikely to cost SNCF any serious money, unlike its EUR 600 million purchase of French logistics group Geodis, which was announced last month along with its acquisition of German rail freight operator Import Transport Logistik.  Ferrovie Nord Cargo saw revenues slip 0.7 per cent in 2006 from EUR 33.688 million to EUR 33.467 million and the company generated a loss for the second-year running.  A EUR 1.754 million loss in 2005 was followed by a slightly-less damaging EUR 207,286 deficit in 2006. More recent figures have not been published but its bottom-line figure is unlikely to have been written in black ink.  With these statistics in mind the purchase is not financially motivated but will allow SNCF to gain a foothold in an important market dominated by Trenitalia, Italy\\'s primary rail firm.  The acquisition could be 1 by June at the earliest and is likely to cost a \"few tens of millions of euros\" according to the FT.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Russian billionaire Vladimir Potanin would be interested in stakebuilding in the nickel producer that brought him his fortune, it has emerged.  The former deputy prime minister of the economy would buy United Company Rusal’s 25.0 per cent stake in Norilsk Nickel if it came up for sale, an official from Potanin’s investment company Interros Holding told Bloomberg.  Rusal, which claims to be the world’s largest aluminium producer, might have to exit Norilsk to reduce debt, according to press speculation.  Bloomberg’s Interros source, who declined to be identified, said there have been no formal talks with Rusal and it is not actively seeking the stock.  Meanwhile, the aluminium producer told Bloomberg its stake in Norilsk, the world’s number one nickel miner, is a “strategic investment” and it is “not looking to sell”.   It has used the 25.0 per cent Norilsk participation – worth around USD 4.04 billion in the markets – as collateral on a USD 4.50 billion loan due in October, Bloomberg observed.  The news provider picked up a separate report from Russian business daily Vedomosti which said Potanin met with government officials last month to test the state’s response to a Norilsk stakebuilding exercise; Interros already owns a quarter of the company.  He asked Dmitry Rybolovlev, the owner of Uralkali, as well as Andrei Melnichenko and Sergei Popov, who control Siberian Coal Energy, to join him in a bid, Vedomosti said.   Potanin was ranked 318th by Forbes in its World’s Billionaires list for 2009, with an estimated net worth of USD 2.10 billion.  He lost out on Norilsk Nickel shares when he split from business partner Mikhail Prokhorov in 2007 and Prokhorov sold stock to Rusal’s billionaire owner Oleg Deripaska.  The Moscow-based nickel and palladium miner made a net loss of USD 449.00 million last year from USD 5.33 billion bottom-line profit in 2007 on a 15.1 per cent decline in revenue.   Its stock has lost two thirds of its value in the last year and 29.1 per cent since the start of June.    © Zephus Ltd',\n",

Inspicio released a statement claiming that the board has noted the recent rise in its share price and \"confirms it has recently received approaches from interested parties which may or may not lead to an offer being made\".  The vault in its price represented the largest in two years. So far the company has relinquished only some of its early gains and was trading 12 per cent up at 214 pence at 11:34am today. After hitting a 52-week low of 138 pence on September 17th, taking into account today\\'s jump, its stock has grown by around 55 per cent in less than a month and it currently has a market value of GBP 188.9 million. Inspicio listed in London in April 2005 at 112.5 pence a share.  The company only has a short and largely unprofitable history after being founded just over two years ago with the aim of acquiring and managing organisations in the previously fragmented testing, inspection and performance conformity markets.  Inspicio operates across more that 125 countries and its businesses include: Inspectorate - a global leader in commodity testing and inspection services;  Environmental Services Group - a leading provider of environmental testing services; Eclipse Scientific Group - the UK\\'s leading food testing business; and Scientifics Group - a leading analytical testing and consultancy business.  In the nine months leading up to December 31st 2005 the group generated turnover of GBP 26.236 million but slipped to a net loss of GBP 4.549 million. During the 12 months up to December 31st 2006, revenues were up dramatically to GBP 161.851 million and the company made a pre-tax profit of GBP 548,000 (compared to a pre-tax loss of GBP 4.497 million during the previous nine months) but the precious metals tester still posted a net loss of GBP 3.086 million.  Net debt shot up to GBP 30.174 million in FY 2006 - with short-term debt accounting for GBP 10.784 million of total debt - and the company had a gearing ratio of 61.21 per cent. Meanwhile its current ratio, liquidity ratio and interest cover ratios came to 1.07, 1.07 and 1.10, respectively.  Interim results for the six months ended June 30th 2007 show turnover was up to GBP 100.7 million compared to GBP 67.8 million in the corresponding period of FY 2006. Inspicio\\'s profit/loss account finally entered the black with a profit of GBP 1.252 million for the first six months of 2007 compared to a GBP 2.913 million loss the year previously, a turnaround of GBP 4.165 million.  The company\\'s main rivals are UK-based Intertek Group and Switzerland\\'s SGS SA. London-based analysis firm Daniel Stewart is of the opinion that the potential bidder could come from a small pool of trade buyers, although a private equity bid cannot be ruled out. An analyst at Daniel Stewart has suggested that Insipicio represents a strategic asset in what is a consolidating sector. However, the source believes that at its current trading levels, Insipicio\\'s price is over 10 per cent higher than its stand-alone fair value price target of 190 pence, which is likely to rule out the prospect of a significant premium being offered.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'French low-cost wireless network start-up Sigfox is looking to raise between USD 200.00 million and USD 300.00 million in financing as its chief executive mulls a possible initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg reported.  In an interview with the news provider, Ludovic Le Moan noted the company will seek the cash by next year to expand its grid for cars, fridges and home-security systems.  The chief executive added an IPO in the US by mid-2017 could also be part of the funding plans.  A potential listing has been in the cards for a while, following press speculation delete earlier this year.  In February Sigfox secured USD 115.00 million in a round of funding from strategic and financial investors in Europe, Asia and North America.  At the time, the Wall Street Journal cited a person close to the company as saying its goal is to list on a US exchange in the next two to three years.  Le Moan told Bloomberg that the plan for Sigfox, which currently has a presence in about ten countries, is to have global coverage and become a leader in the Internet of Things, as nobody else in the industry has a network that covers the whole world.  The Labège-headquartered firm is the first and only company to provide global cellular connectivity in the sector, according to its website.  Sigfox’s network targets automated objects rather than mobile devices and claims to take inspiration from how submarines communicated during World War One, using wavelengths that carry less information but travel further.  The company has offices in Paris, Madrid and San Francisco.  According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, this transaction represents Sigfox’s fifth funding round to date.  In 2011 the group raised EUR 2.00 million from Partech International, iXo Private Equity and Elaia Partners in its first-ever investment.  As well as February’s USD 115.00 million injection, Sigfox brought in EUR 10.00 million in 2012 and EUR 15.00 million in 2014.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

According to the sources, possible bidders could comprise private equity firms.  One of the options being considered is a public to private transaction, as well as the acquisition of a peer by the Paderborn-headquartered group, the people told Reuters.  Wincor Nixdorf is yet to officially appoint an advisor and may still decide against a move, the sources noted.  Reuters cited one person as saying the company is cautious that smaller steps may not be enough to secure the future of the firm and a bolder deal could fare better.  Wincor Nixdorf claims to be one of the world’s leading providers of information technology services to banks and the retail industry.  The group, which had a market capitalisation of EUR 1.29 billion on 7th April, the last trading day prior to the report, has a presence in around 130 countries worldwide.  Shares closed up 8.0 per cent to EUR 46.60 yesterday.  Wincor Nixdorf employs over 9,000 people at its subsidiaries, which have locations across 42 countries.  The company posted net sales of EUR 640.00 million in the quarter ended 31st December 2014, a 0.3 per cent increase on EUR 638.00 million in the corresponding timeframe of 2013.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation fell 12.5 per cent to EUR 49.00 million in Q1 2015 (Q1 2014: EUR 56.00 million).

According to one of the sources, the business competes with firms such as US-based NCR and Japan’s Oki Electric, none of which have been named as potential takeover targets.  If Wincor should decide on an acquisition it would be expected to buy in emerging markets where ATM numbers are still on the rise, another person observed.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'UK utility Centrica might make a cash offer for the Aberdeen-based oil and gas company Venture Production, it confirmed today after upping its stake to 22.3 per cent.  The gas and electricity giant bought Venture shares at 725.00 pence apiece through its wholly-owned subsidiary Centrica Resources, paying a 27.6 per cent premium over yesterday’s close of 580.00 pence.  Centrica paid GBP 239.40 million for a stake in a company that acquires, operates and revitalises oil and gas fields that have proven but untapped potential.  Venture, which focuses on the North Sea, said it believes the price of 725.00 pence per unit “substantially undervalues the company, its prospects and strategic position particularly with regard to its UK gas resources”.   It urged investors to take no action, and they might be amenable given that they received an 8.0 per cent increase in proposed dividend last year despite disastrous results for global stocks.   At the end of 2008, Venture was producing 45,000 barrels of oil (equivalent) per day – compared to 200 barrels in 1999 – from sites that were previously believed to be uneconomic or too technically difficult.  “Centrica, through its broker, Goldman Sachs International, may acquire further shares in Venture”, the utility said, noting it is “considering its options in relation to Venture”.  These “could include making a possible cash offer”, though there is no certainty a bid will be tabled.   Shares in Venture were 27.6 per cent higher at 740.00 pence apiece at 12:14 pm GMT on the announcement.   They had been as high as 747.50 pence in earlier trades – and even before today’s gains had advanced more than a third so far this year spurred by traders talk of a possible bid from Centrica.  Bloomberg cited Gordon Gray, an analyst at Collins Stewart, as saying Venture is one of its “top picks” in the exploration and production sector.  “Growth will be fairly modest this year, reserves growth should be strong and should presage stronger volumes in 2010-11,” Gray added.  In 2008, revenue surged 38.0 per cent to GBP 494.90 million (FY 2007: GBP 358.3 million) thanks to increased production volumes and soaring commodity prices.  Operating profit almost doubled to GBP 231.10 million (FY 2007: GBP 116.60 million) and Venture’s cash flow from operating activities rose 27.0 per cent to GBP 305.00 million (FY 2007: GBP 240.20 million).   © Zephus Ltd',\n",

The company intends to conduct a placing in the hope of raising at least EUR 5.00 million.  Proceeds of this offering will contribute towards continuing the development of its products, supporting the group’s domestic growth and expanding into the UK.  An initial public offering would also have other benefits; Big Red Cloud believes the resulting heightened profile would enable it to recruit more staff while giving it increased access to any growth capital it may need in the future.  The board have also said a quotation would give the firm more credibility.  On top of these points, the company also hopes to repay some of its debts.  Big Red Cloud was founded in 1992 as a division of accountancy firm Bryan Phelan Associates with a view to designing software to improve efficiency for accountants.  It subsequently merged with Irish International Sales in 2001.  According to chief executive Marc O’Dwyer, Big Red Cloud’s software is currently used by 1,982 companies and 561 accountants, in spite of having only been launched as recently as September 2012.  It hopes to soon replicate this success in the UK.  There were five IPOs by Irish companies in 2013, according to data from Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk.  The two most valuable of these involved real estate investment trusts floating on the London Stock Exchange; Hibernia REIT went public in December, raising EUR 384.96 million in the process, while Green REIT listed in July to the tune of EUR 309.60 million.  According to Zephyr, the only other IPO with a disclosed value was on AIM; rockdrills manufacturer Mincon Group secured EUR 50.00 million in November.

       " 'The UK\\'s third-largest gas producer BG Group saw its share price rise by 4.12 per cent yesterday amid speculation that for the first time it is being targeted by a strategic long-term investor.  BG group has operations in some 25 countries over five continents and focuses on four key business sectors: Exploration and production, liquefied natural gas, transmission and distribution, and power.  Yesterday Bloomberg published analysis of BG\\'s share registration data by analysts at London stockbrokers Cazenove Group, which illustrated that the People\\'s Bank of China (PBOC) has accumulated 15.5 million shares in the gas producer between June 15 and July 13. Based on its close on Tuesday of GBP 8.08 the stake accumulated is worth close to USD 125 million and represents a 0.458 per cent stake.  As the holding is below the three per cent threshold required to be officially confirmed, speculation has mounted regarding the bidder\\'s identity and its intentions.   The Bloomberg news agency also disclosed that a BG spokeswoman confirmed that bank is indeed a shareholder - but refused to verify the size of the stake - whilst a PBOC official declined to comment and declared that the bank does not have any direct investment business.   This led to the 0 mill churning out speculation that the PBOC made the purchase as a third party on behalf of a state investment fund in China that is yet to be formally established. If this is the case it would mirror a similar transaction which saw an investment unit of the bank purchasing a 10 per cent stake in US private equity giant Blackstone also on behalf of the unnamed state fund that is being established to manage close to USD 200 billion of China\\'s foreign exchange reserves.  New York-based advisory firm Eurasia Group is a firm believer of this line of speculation, leading it to publish a note stating that the investor will \"almost certainly increase its very small initial investment in BG Group\" and raise the prospect of a potential future takeover bid. The chance of the investor pursuing a much larger stake was also highlighted by Cazenove.  The Reading-based firm saw its turnover increase by 41.48 per cent in the 2006 financial year to GBP 7,674 million (FY 2005: GBP 5,424 million) and its net income hit a company record 1,779 billion (FY 2005: GBP 1,525 million) despite its profit margin slipping from 46.17 per cent to a still healthy 42.81 per cent. Its price to earning ratio currently ranks among the lowest it has been since the turn of the century (see BvD Osiris product), suggesting that the timing for an investment is right.  The lack of serious speculation regarding a full takeover of the provider leads to an indication that a bid for the whole company is remote in the short-term and would cost any admirer in excess of GBP 30 billion.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Swedish triple play company Com Hem is entering the domestic single dwelling unit (SDU) market via the acquisition of Boxer TV-Access for an enterprise value of SEK 1.33 billion (USD 163.60 million).  The Stockholm suitor has started rolling out fibre-based networks on the back of successful trials within this targeted sector and as such expects to add 800,000 households in the future.  Its expansion programme is carried out via techniques such as unbundling fibre, using third party open local area networks and, to a smaller extent, building out its own coax network.  Com Hem believes the SDU market is its next major pillar of growth as it should help turn the company into a countrywide operator in broadband and TV services.  Enter Boxer TV-Access as a springboard into this targeted sector: the bulk of its 500,000 customers receive their TV offering through the Swedish digital terrestrial network.  The Stockholm-headquartered business, which is a subsidiary of state-owned terrestrial broadcast transmission operator Teracom Boxer Group, provides about 40 channels on a subscription basis via various packages.  It also offers live TV and demand services through apps for smartphones and tablets while its broadband and telephony activities rely on fibre infrastructure.  Founded in 1999, Boxer TV-Access employs about 40 staff, focused mainly on sales and marketing and customer service, and had revenue of SEK 1.88 billion in 2015.  Com Hem is acquiring the business from Teracom for a total SEK 1.55 billion, including the assumption of SEK 220.00 million in cash.  The SEK 1.33 billion enterprise value represents an estimated 2016 underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) multiple of 4.4x, based on a rolling 12 months EBITDA estimate of SEK 300.00 million.  According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, the acquisition is one of the ten largest by value targeting a Swedish company so far this calendar year.  While Mylan’s SEK 83.60 billion takeover of Meda far outweighs any other, Boxer TV-Access would be more in line with the SEK 1.41 billion purchase of Fortnox by Visma.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",

However, as with any such scheme, the idea comes with a price tag. Managing director Gerald Michaluk told the Herald that the company is on the verge of spending GBP 15,000 to acquire a small piece of equipment which would pave the way for beer to be kegged by machine.  Michaluk added that staff training and health and safety issues have already taken place and now all the manufacturer is waiting for is money to install the “all singing, all dancing” process at the soon-to be revived former Rosebank facility in Falkirk.  According to the media, Arran will start offering shares to investors at the end of October, a move which would come almost ten months after the company entered into a distribution agreement with Germany’s Hofbrau.  Considering it will be rolling out the Munich-based brewer’s beer kegs in Scotland it makes sense to supply its own alcohol in the same format.  According to the Scotsman, Hofbrau will make its debut in Scotland at this year’s Highland Games on Brodick.  Michaluk told the newspaper he has ambitious plans and the introduction of kegged Blonde would expand Arran’s market when coupled with the distribution agreement.  Separately, he told the Herald the kegging process would get the company’s product into bars where the staff are not trained up enough to handle cask ale.   © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " \"Dealertrack Technologies was the most advanced in after-hours trading on Nasdaq yesterday evening after saying it is acquiring Dealer.com for roughly USD 1.00 billion in a deal which provides an exit for Apax Partners.  The provider of on-demand software used by automotive retailers filed the announcement after the bell rang yesterday, stating the payment comprises USD 620.00 million in cash and 8.70 million stocks currently worth USD 372.36 million in the markets.  Established in 1998, Dealer.com designs and runs websites and provides marketing and operations software and services for the automotive industry.  The Vermont-based group’s platforms significantly lower the cost of customer acquisition while enhancing dealers' efficiency and profitability.  It offers advertising software that links dealers with digital campaigns on search engines Google and Yahoo! and on social sites such as Facebook.  It also provides a customer relationship management system comprising dashboards, pencil tools and activity rankings, among other things.  Dealer.com is billed as the auto retailing industry's technology and market share leader, working with 80.0 per cent of the top 125 dealerships as recognised by Automotive News.  The business has 830 employees across its Burlington and Californian offices and serves about 7,000 US new or used car distributors.  It is expected to generate annual revenue of more than USD 230.00 million in 2013, representing an increase of a quarter from 2012.  Apax came on board as a shareholder in March 2011 after buying Trader from Yellow media for CAD 745.00 million, or USD 763.00 million at the time.  The assets on the block comprised Canada's leading online automotive classified marketplace AutoTrader.ca and a 30.0 per cent stake in digital dealer marketing service provider Dealer.com.  According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, the deal is one of the largest by value targeting a Vermont-based business and is certainly the biggest in the last five to six years.  Dealer.com, with a value just shy of USD 1.00 billion, comes behind the USD 1.90 billion takeover of lender Chittenden by People's United Financial 1 at the beginning of 2008 and the acquisition of IDX Systems by GE Healthcare in 2006 for USD 1.20 billion.   © Zephus Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Johnson Service Group, Britain\\'s leading drycleaning agency, issued another profit warning on Wednesday sending its shares down 18.6 per cent and sparking talk of a private equity bid.  Yesterday, the group\\'s stocks plummeted from an open of 180 pence to 146.5 pence and were falling again this morning, trading at 141.75 pence at 11:29am from an open of 149.5 pence.  The Bootle-based corporate services firm, which has divisions in drycleaning, textile rental, corporate wear and facilities management, downgraded its 2007 profit forecast on the back of \"disappointing\" trading in three of its non-core units and said 2008 results could be affected.  Along with talk from the Independent of a bid for the entire company, the announcement fired 0s that Johnson might sell off these non-core businesses.  \"The board is in the process of a restructuring programme which is being actively pursued,\" was the comment that came with this week\\'s profit warning.   On releasing first-half results in September, which saw operating profit fall from GBP 20.4 million to a loss of GBP 8.6 million year-on-year, chairman Simon Sherrard said: \"The next few months will involve further reorganisation.\"   Chief executive John Skinner, who took up his position in April, is certainly under pressure to produce some positive results.  Johnson investors have seen shares lose 58.8 per cent of their value since Mr Skinner took over six month\\'s ago.  With the group\\'s market cap reduced to GBP 86.98 million from around GBP 211.726 million over the six-month period, the firm is clearly vulnerable to private equity bids.  A source told Reuters that Johnson\\'s three specialist service units were the likely sale candidates.  The trio are: hotel laundry business Stalbridge Linen Services, which is part of the textile rental division; facilities management unit Workplace Engineering, which provides mechanical, electrical and building fabric maintenance services; and Alex Reid, the UK\\'s leading supplier to the clothes care sector, which is part of Johnson\\'s drycleaning operations.   \"They are short term non-core; there\\'s no clearer way of putting it,\" the source said.  Last year, Johnson decided to auction the consumer facing part of the drycleaning division, which encompasses the Johnsons Cleaners, Jeeves of Belgravia and Sketchley brands. Distribution specialist Alex Reid, which saw 11 per cent revenue growth in 2006, would not have fallen under this bracket.  Stalbridge, which claims a market-leading position in its sector but has been highlighted by management as a poor performer, made an operating loss of GBP 3.8 million in 2006 from a profit of GBP 4.4 million in 2005 after a new invoicing system brought to light costs that had previously been masked.   The period saw Stalbridge offset the strong performance of Johnsons Apparelmaster in the textile rental division and put strain on Johnson\\'s cashflow, lending credibility to the theory it is facing an auction.  Workplace Engineering, a specialist mechanical and engineering business, is the round peg in the proverbial square hole and an obvious sale choice given the lack of strategic fit with Johnson\\'s other operations.  It demonstrated significant top-line growth in a highly competitive market last year, increasing turnover from an annualised GBP 4.6 million to GBP 14.2 million in just over two years.   Against this background, the unit saw 20 per cent operating profit growth to GBP 1.3 million and an operating margin of 9.1 per cent.  Divesting the unit would ease the pressure on Mr Skinner to reduce Johnson\\'s debts, which according to BvD data stood at GBP 142.5 million last year, suggesting the groups debts are 57-times higher than the corresponding net income of GBP 2.5 million.  Johnson\\'s arrears have been growing consistently since 2003 (FY 2005: GBP 137.2 million; FY 2004: GBP 74.1 million; FY 2003: GBP 43.4 million) and with its equity value standing at almost half 2006 debt levels, it is fair to say the firm\\'s bosses will be looking to bring in some cash as soon as possible.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " \"Sterling Jewelers, a unit of Signet Jewelers, is acquiring jewellery e-commerce firm R2Net via an all-cash deal worth around USD 328.00 million.   The sellers are private equity investors Israel Growth Partners and Francisco Partners Management, as well as four of the target’s founders Oded Edelman, James Schultz, Michele Sigler and Dean Lederman.   Subject to regulatory approvals, the deal is expected to close by 29th October 2018.  The four founders will effectively retain some exposure to the target following the deal as they are planning to invest a portion of the sales proceeds in Signet.  To help finance the deal, JP Morgan has provided the purchaser with a term loan, which is expected to be repaid by the end of next year.  New York-based R2Net is best known as the operator of JamesAllen.com, an online engagement ring shopping platform.    Listed on both the London and New York stock exchanges, Signet is billed as the largest specialty jewellery retailer in the UK, US and Canada.  It operates about 3,600 outlets which trade under several brand names, including Kay Jewelers, Ernest Jones, Zales and H Smauel.  Signet posted sales of USD 6.41 billion in the 12 months ended 28th January 2017, down 2.2 per cent on the USD 6.55 billion recorded during the same timeframe in the previous year.  Net income for the period totalled USD 543.20 million, compared to USD 467.90 million in the corresponding interval of 2016.  Commenting on the acquisition, the purchaser's co-founder and chief executive said: “By joining forces with Signet, we believe we will be able to accelerate the growth of JamesAllen.com and our adjacent R2Net businesses while continuing to build on our unique culture and technology.  According to Zephyr, the M&A database published by Bureau van Dijk, there have been 28 announced or 1 deals targeting electronic shopping services providers in the US since the beginning of this year.   © Zephus Ltd\",\n",
       " 'Australian mineral explorer Carbine Resources is adopting a new strategy of generating cash flow by gaining exposure to the Mount Morgan gold-copper deposit through the progressive acquisition of Raging Bull Metals (RBM).  This asset is a historic site about 38.00 kilometres from Rockhampton on the central Queensland coast and is covered by 30 mining leases over 677.50 hectares, all of which are currently fully owned by Norton Gold Fields.  During its operational life, it has produced 8.40 million ounces of gold, 400,000 tonnes of copper and 1.20 million ounces of silver.  RBM is the current holder of an agreement with Norton to acquire the project, which includes Mount Morgan’s associated Kundana carbin-in pulp (CIP) processing plant.  This facility has been fully decommissioned and has nominal capacity of 1.00 million tonnes per annum for treatment of tailings at the mine.  However, Kundana provides an opportunity to significantly reduce capital costs connected with future construction of processing facilities at the site.  Under the development strategy, Carbine intends to immediately kick off a detailed metallurgical test programme to confirm viability of the proposed flow sheet for gold and copper extraction, paving the way for a bankable feasibility study (BFS).  The listed explorer, which currently has assets in Burkina Faso, is taking over RBM from Raging Bull Mining in a bid to focus on using mining technology to advance projects with low geological risk and near-term production potential.  Carbine has entered into an earn-in agreement to fully acquire Mount Morgan by sole funding to completion of the BFS for an initial 75.0 per cent, before executing an option to pick up the remaining quarter via independent valuation.  As part of the agreement, the group is also picking up a 100.0 per cent interest in Norton’s Many Peaks copper and gold exploration tenements.  The group has first right to earn-in to a pipeline of projects under development by Raging Bull, which will receive 25.00 million new Carbine shares once the project produces 10,000 ounces of gold and also on 5,000 tonnes of copper.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'UK-based defence, security and aerospace company BAE Systems is holding merger discussions with its Dutch peer EADS.  The firms are considering joining forces in a deal that would create a new dual listed structure, with both businesses operating as one group while continuing to be quoted separately on their existing stock exchanges.  Should a deal go ahead, BAE shareholders would own a 40.0 per cent stake in the enlarged entity, with EADS investors to hold the remaining 60.0 per cent.  A unified board and management structure that would see each business having identical boards and executive committees would most likely be introduced.  Both companies believe a merger would benefit their existing customer bases and shareholders as a result of cost reductions and possible new business opportunities.  They expect their combination to create a world class international aerospace, defence and security group with a presence in countries such as France, Germany, Spain, the UK and the US through its centres of manufacturing and technology.  The transaction would be subject to approval by both firm’s boards and shareholders, as well as governmental and regulatory bodies, although as yet there can be no guarantee that any deal will take place.  Under the terms of the city code on takeovers and mergers, both companies must now announce an agreement or make it clear they do not plan to go through with the merger by 10th October, although if discussions are still ongoing BAE has said it will request a deadline extension at this time.  EADS is headquartered in Leiden and was founded in 2000.  The company employs 133,000 people across more than 170 sites worldwide and is a world leader in the aerospace and defence sectors, according to its website.  BAE Systems is based in London and has around 100,000 employees in Australia, India, Saudi Arabia, the UK and the US.  It recorded sales of GBP 8.33 billion in the six months ended 30th June 2012, down 9.8 per cent on the GBP 9.23 billion generated during the same period in 2011.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'The UK government is to sell the balance of its shareholding in the country’s postal service, Royal Mail, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has said.  According to the BBC, Osborne told members of parliament the 30.0 per cent stake, which is worth GBP 1.50 billion, will be jettisoned in order to help pay down the deficit, a goal he hopes to realise by fiscal year 2018/19.  The Chancellor said he hopes to complete this task without a resulting increase in income tax or value added tax, although he acknowledged such a feat will be tricky to accomplish.  According to Osborne, the decision to offload the balance of Royal Mail is the right move for the company, as well as for taxpayers.  However, the announcement has naturally not been without its critics and the BBC said the Labour party accused the Chancellor of springing the announcement on other MPs and going against his long term economic plan.  No concrete timeframe for the divestment has been given, but Osborne has been quoted as saying a sale will go ahead when ministers are sure they will get value for money.  Until relatively recently Royal Mail was wholly-owned by the UK government; the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition which took charge in 2010 revived previously shelved plans to sell of part of the business.  This ultimately led to a flotation on the London Stock Exchange in October 2013, with GBP 1.72 billion raised from the listing of a 52.2 per cent stake.  A further 7.8 per cent was sold via an over-allotment option and 10.0 per cent of the company was given to employees, leaving the government with 30.0 per cent.  Earlier this year Royal Mail 1 an acquisition of its own, paying an undisclosed consideration for Nottingham-headquartered ecommerce software developer StoreFeeder in February.  © Zephus Ltd',\n",
       " 'Swedish automobile retailer Bilia has announced plans to buy the BMW dealer operations owned by local rival Auto7H.  The companies have agreed terms on a purchase in which the acquiror will issue shares worth around SEK 10.00 million (USD 1.51 million) as consideration, with an additional SEK 20.00 million to be paid in cash.  As a result, Bilia will continue to expand and will establish a strong presence in western Sweden, an area where it has not been represented previously.  The firm also hopes to enhance its customer base as a result and expects capital employed to increase by about SEK 60.00 million and net loan debt by around SEK 50.00 million following the close of the acquisition.  Auto7H’s dealerships in Borås and Skene, which are operated under the Subaru, Suzuki and Peugeot brands, will be retained and continue in their present form.  Subject to approval by the Swedish Competition Authority, completion is expected on 1st November, at which time economic operations will be transferred, with possession of the activities anticipated during December.

The group is focusing on providing a unique service which combines the expertise of magic circle law companies with the partner-led view of a boutique.   Jon Gilligan, managing partner of the buyer, noted: “This is a great development both for GQ and Camfords, and for our respective clients and people. Camfords, like GQ, is focused on helping businesses to resolve complex, high value employment law issues.  “It also shares GQ’s desire to challenge the traditional, full service law firms and deliver legal services in a different way to enable clients to resolve difficult human resources issues more quickly, simply and cost-effectively.”  Gilligan added that the combination of both parties will be beneficial to customers and could also create a leading position as the UK’s most highly regarded boutique company in the industry.  Completion is expected on 4th January 2016.  Guildford-based Camfords was founded in 2010 and advises multi-national companies and individuals across a number of industry’s including insurance, technology and luxury goods worldwide.

Under the terms of the transaction, the buyer will pay USD 100.00 million for the unit, as well as an additional USD 20.00 million earn-out, which will be due at a later date subject to certain growth targets being achieved in the year following completion.  Sophos will finance the deal using existing cash resources and an extension of existing credit facilities.  Commenting on the deal, the buyer’s chief executive Kris Hagerman said: “Invincea will strengthen Sophos' leading next-gen endpoint protection with complementary predictive defences that we believe will become increasingly important to the future of endpoint protection and allow us to take full advantage of this significant new growth opportunity.”  Closing is expected to follow around the end of the current fiscal year, subject to regulatory approvals, and Invincea’s office in Fairfax will be retained upon completion of the deal.  The target’s Invincea Labs business is not part of the deal.   The Virginian firm’s investors include ORIX USA, Comerica Bank, Dell Ventures, New Atlantic Ventures and Harbert Management, all of whom will exit as a consequence of the transaction.  Its most recent funding round closed in November 2016, when it secured USD 10.00 million from those parties, among others.  Invincea was founded in 2009 and claims to have built one of the strongest and most effective next-generation endpoint technologies on the market.  Sophos’ most recent acquisition was in November 2016, when it paid an undisclosed sum to buy Irish data breach detection software provider Barricade Security Systems from investors including Frontline Ventures, Tribal Ventures, Business Switch and the SaaS Syndicate.
